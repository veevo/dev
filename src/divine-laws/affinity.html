					<header><h3>The Law of Affinity</h3></header>
					
					To put it simply, it says that ignorant people will be attracted to other ignorant people,
					and wise/good people will be naturally attracted to equally good people.

					When an ignorant medium tries to communicate with spirits, equally ignorant spirits will be attracted o him.
					
					While when a good person tries to communicate with Spirits, good spirits will be attracted to him or her and communicate.
