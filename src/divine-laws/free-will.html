					<header><h3>The Law of Free Will / Law of Liberty</h3></header>
					
					Human Beings are given the <a href="/divine-laws/progress">free will to act</a>, but they must answer for the consequences of their actions.

					There is no fate. From the moment of our creation we are free to take whatever paths we wish to take. We can learn and evolve at our own pace and deal with the consequences of our mistakes as we see fit. When it is time for us to reincarnate we even choose our next existence and the trials that we will learn from in that existence. Even the nature of our death and length of our lives are in our hands.
