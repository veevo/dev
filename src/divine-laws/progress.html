					<header><h3>The Law of Progress</h3></header>
					
					Human Beings are given the <a href="/divine-laws/progress">free will to act</a>, but they must answer for the consequences of their actions.

					Progress is vital to the evolution of a society. Which means that the scientific discoveries that change our society daily, are actually a vital part of Godâ€™s plan for all of us. Of course the ethical evolution of a society is also a critical part of this progress. So when scientific discoveries are applied in a society void of solid ethical principles, these tools become instruments of harm instead of the instruments of learning they were intended to be used for.

					As for the individual the Law of Progress means that a person is always learning and evolving. A person can get caught up in obsessions and destructive behavior but they can never forget those lessons that have truly been learned or loose the evolution gained from such learning.
