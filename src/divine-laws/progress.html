					<header><h3>The Law of Progress</h3></header>

					<p>
						Human Beings are given the <a href="/divine-laws/progress">free will to act</a>, but they must answer for the consequences of their actions.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Progress is vital to the evolution of a society. Which means that the scientific discoveries that change our society daily, are actually a vital part of Godâ€™s plan for all of us. Of course the ethical evolution of a society is also a critical part of this progress. So when scientific discoveries are applied in a society void of solid ethical principles, these tools become instruments of harm instead of the instruments of learning they were intended to be used for.
					</p>

					<p>
						As for the individual the Law of Progress means that a person is always learning and evolving. A person can get caught up in obsessions and destructive behavior but they can never forget those lessons that have truly been learned or loose the evolution gained from such learning.
