					<p>
						Love is the basis of all of Godâ€™s laws and gifts <a href="/about/god">God</a> has given us. It is the driving force for all
						<a href="/divine-laws/progress">progress</a> and the constant state of being for all superior spirits.
						
						It is the antitheses for the materialist, instinct driven view of the universe man, in his <a href="/issues/ignorance"> ignorance</a>, lives by.
						
						Unselfish love was the message <a href="/about/jesus">Jesus</a> brought to humanity and died on the cross to make sure the lesson was never forgotten.
