					<header><h3>The Law of Love</h3></header>
					
					Love is the basis of all of Godâ€™s laws and gifts God has given us. It is the driving force for all progress and the constant state of being for all superior spirits. It is the antitheses for the materialist, instinct driven view of the universe man, in his ignorance, lives by. Unselfish love was the message Jesus brought to humanity and died on the cross to make sure the lesson was never forgotten.
