					<header><h3>The Law of Free Will / Law of Liberty</h3></header>
					
					We all possess the gift of free will, but eventually the consequences of past choices push us into situations that correspond directly to those choices. These effects are not punishments, but tools for learning which is fundamental to our evolution.

					So the trials, lessons, and progress of every reincarnation are the effects of all our past decisions. After every reincarnation a personâ€™s spirit guide shows them all the major decisions of that existence. Emphasizing the intention behind the action, the consequences of these actions and how these actions affected others. Once a person has faced the very best and worst of themselves they choose how the consequences of these actions will play out in their next existence.
