					<header><h3>The Law of Society</h3></header>
					<p>
						The forming of societies is natural to human beings, it is necessary for intellectual and ethical progress.						
					</p>
					<p>
						And in order for human societies to function and thrive they must have laws. Of course the ethical evolution of a society is clearly seen by the way their laws protect, give equal rights, and serve the societies citizens. The more ignorant and corrupt the society is, the more its laws reflect the self-centered destructive nature of those in control.
