## What is the perispirit?
[Spirit](/about/spirit) [incarnated](/about/incarnation) in a [material body](/about/physical-body). The [perispirit](/about/perispirit) is the semi-material body that unites the Spirit to the physical body.

In addition to the corporeal world inhabited by incarnate Spirits, which are Human Beings, there exists the spiritual world, inhabited by discarnate Spirits.

As described on The Mediums Book, the Perispirit is

> a semi-material envelope part of the ‘spirit’. The perispirit is the part of the spirit that can be modified and changed in order for a spirit to be able to act upon its environment. The term Perispirit is from the Greek, meaning Outer Spirit or Around the Spirit. The perispirit has roughly the same appearance of the spirits’ last incarnation and is what we actually see in apparitions.
