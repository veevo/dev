					<p>
						Human Being is a <a href="/about/spirit">Spirit</a> <a href="/about/incarnation">incarnated</a> in a material body.
						The <a href="/about/perspirit">perispirit</a> is the semi-material body that unites the Spirit
						to the <a href="/about/material-world">physical body</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition to the <a href="/about/material-world">material world </a>
						inhabited by incarnate Spirits, which are <a href="/about/human-being">Human Beings</a>,
						there exists the <a href="/about/spiritual-world">spiritual world</a>, inhabited by discarnate Spirits.
					</p>

					Human Beings are given the <a href="/divine-laws/free-will">free will to act</a>, but they must answer for the consequences of their actions.

					Within the Universe there are other inhabited worlds, with beings at different degrees of evolution: some equal, others more or less evolved than Human Beings.
