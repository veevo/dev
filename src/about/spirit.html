					<header><h3>What is a Spirit</h3></header>
					<p>
						Human Being is a <a href="/about/spirit">Spirit</a> incarnated in a material body. The <a href="/about/perispirit">perispirit</a> is the semi-material body that unites the Spirit to the physical body.
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition to the corporeal world inhabited by incarnate Spirits, which are Human Beings, there exists the 
						<a href="/about/spiritual-world">spiritual world</a>, inhabited by discarnate Spirits.
					</p>

					<header><h3>Creation of Spirits</h3></header>
					Spirits are created simple and ignorant. The Spirits are the intelligent beings of creation. They constitute the world of the Spirits, which pre-exists and outlives everything.
					
					<header><h3>Evolution of Spirits</h3></header>
					They evolve intellectually and morally, passing from a lower order to a higher one, until they attain perfection, where they will enjoy unalterable bliss.
					
					<header><h3>Incarnation</h3></header>
					Spirits preserve their individuality before, during, and after each incarnation.
					
					Spirits reincarnate as many times as is necessary for their spiritual advancement.
					
					<header><h3>Progression</h3></header>
					Spirits are always progressing. In their multiple physical existences, they may sometimes become stationary
					but they <a href="/divine-laws/progress">never regress</a>.
					The speed of their intellectual and moral progress depends on the efforts they make to attain perfection.
					
					<header><h3>Order of Spirits</h3></header>
					Spirits belong to different orders according to the degree of perfection they have attained: Pure Spirits, who have attained maximum perfection; Good Spirits, whose predominant desire is towards goodness; and Imperfect Spirits, characterized by their ignorance, their tendency towards evil, and by their lower passions.
					
					<header><h3>Interaction with Humanity</h3></header>
					The Spirits’ relations with Human Beings are constant and have always existed. The Good Spirits attract us towards goodness, sustain us in life’s trials, and help us bear them with courage and resignation. The Imperfect Spirits induce us towards error.
