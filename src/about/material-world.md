## What is a Material World?
In addition to the corporeal world inhabited by incarnate Spirits, which are Human Beings, there exists the spiritual world, inhabited by discarnate Spirits.

Within the Universe there are other inhabited worlds, with beings at different degrees of evolution: some equal, others more or less evolved than Human Beings.
