					<p>
						Human Being is a <a href="/about/spirit">Spirit</a> incarnated in a material body. The <a href="/about/perispirit">perispirit</a> is the semi-material body that unites the Spirit to the physical body.
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition to the corporeal world inhabited by incarnate Spirits, which are Human Beings, there exists the 
						<a href="/about/spiritual-world">spiritual world</a>, inhabited by discarnate Spirits.
					</p>
					
					<p>As described on <a href="/books/kardec/mediums-book">The Mediums Book</a>,
						<blockquote>
							The perturbation popularly named poltergeist is caused by an ignorant spirit taking advantage of an untrained natural medium. If the medium learns how to control his/her gift he will not be disturbed by it. Sometimes the medium loses his/her gift after puberty.
