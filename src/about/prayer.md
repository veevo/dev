## What is Prayer

Prayer is an act of adoration for [God](/about/god). It is found in the natural law and is the result of an innate sentiment in every Human Being, just as the idea of the existence of the Creator is innate.

Prayer makes [Human Beings](/about/human-being) better. Whoever prays with fervor and confidence grows stronger against evil temptations, and God sends the Good [Spirits](/about/spiritss) to assist them. This type of assistance will never be denied when requested with sincerity.
