## What is God?

»  God is eternal, immutable, unique, omnipotent, supremely just and good.

»  The universe is a creation of God. It encompasses all beings, whether they be rational or irrational, animate or inanimate, material or immaterial.

»  All the laws of nature are [Divine Laws](/divine-laws) because God is their author. They cover both the physics and moral laws.
