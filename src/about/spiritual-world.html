						In addition to the <a href="/about/material-world">corporeal world</a> inhabited by incarnate Spirits,
						which are <a href="/about/human-being">Human Beings</a>, there exists the spiritual world,

					Within the Universe there are other inhabited worlds, with beings at different degrees of evolution: some equal, others more or less evolved than Human Beings.
