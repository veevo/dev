					<header><h3>What is Prayer</h3></header>
					<p>
						Prayer is an act of adoration for <a href="/about/god">God</a>. It is found in the natural law and is the result of an innate sentiment in every Human Being, just as the idea of the existence of the Creator is innate.
					</p>

					<p>
						Prayer makes <a href="/about/human-being">Human Beings</a> better. Whoever prays with fervor and confidence grows stronger against evil temptations, and God sends the Good <a href="/about/spirit">Spirits</a> to assist them.
						This type of assistance will never be denied when requested with sincerity.
