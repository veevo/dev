					<header><h3>Introduction</h3></header>					
					<p>The question “Is there life after death?” has been the subject of profound discuission and controversey in both the religious and secular world for as long as recorded history. It’s a question that leads us to consider another just as intretsing question. “Why is it so important for us to need to know? Yes, a basic fear of death, the seperation from loved ones, a deeper reason for existing, are all parts of it, but the answer is much more basic, it is all about identity.</p>
