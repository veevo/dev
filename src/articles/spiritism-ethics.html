						<h3>Introduction</h3>
					</header>
					<p>ETHICS is considered by many to be a somewhat esoteric topic. What most do understand about ethics is that it has something to do with good and bad, and that it is a controversial topic. Ethics has two aspects, first its definition: what does ethics mean. How what is ethical and not ethical can be identified. Second, its practice: the practical application, evolution and modification of a persons ethical code of conduct.</p>

						<h3>DEFINITION OF ETHICS</h3>
					</header>
					<p>Simply, ethics is the rational understanding of what is correct behavior and what is not correct behavior. Ethics is usually defined by its identification with Religion, Culture and/or the Law. In truth these definitions are all too limiting.</p>
					<p>With Religion, ethics is defined as an absolute code of conduct specified in that faith’s dogmatic writings. This kind of code of conduct, not reasoned (by man), never changing, is commonly called Morality. Ethics can not be defined as just Morality because Religious Dogma is intended only for the followers of that particular faith. In order for any ethical code to remain relevant and stand the test of time it has to be flexible, rational, applicable to varying groups of people and willing to change as peoples understanding of the world changes.</p>
					<p>With culture, ethics is referred to as ‘traditional values’. It is limited to groups of people sharing common history, traditions, set of beliefs and ancestry. These traditional values come about slowly with time, having many unreasoned elements, aspects that are prejudiced, discriminatory, illegal, filled with contradictions, and an unwillingness to change even as people become wiser and more experienced.</p>
					<p>With the Law, ethics is the ‘Institutions Of Law’, each controlling different categories of a societies rules of conduct. These rules are limited to what is specified within the official government approved documents of a particular nation or group. These kinds of ethics can shift dramatically with changes in the political parties controlling law making bodies, changes in the intentions of a government, or changes in the beliefs of the voting majority (within democracies). Because of these shifts, law based ethics are considered by many to be hypocritical, and more an act of government/political control than something to respect and live by.</p>
					<p>For others laws are seen in terms of the ‘Social Compromise’, meaning they are necessary for a society to function but not reflective of personal ethics, or conduct. These standards of conduct are considered only in terms of the dependency upon the services provided by the society, and a wish not to be punished by that society.</p>
					<p>Any ethical code that changes as part of any ‘agenda’ can not be accurate, or a product of rational thinking. By the same token any code that is followed only because of dependency and fear is not going to be reflected anyone’s reasoned and honest personal code of conduct.</p>

						<h3>Spiritisim and the Law</h3>
					</header>
					<p>t is important to take this moment to point out Spiritism’s view of the rule of law. It clarifies the importance of the ‘social compromise’, and how the evolution of societies is governed by ‘universal Law of Progress’. It is true that because of Human ignorance no nation has laws that are truly fair and reasoned, but eventually with time and the evolution of all societies, their laws too will reflect that progress. As for Spiritism’s attitude toward following societies laws it says:</p>
					<blockquote>
							Gospel according to Spiritism chapter 2 section 7
							“.. prescribes respect for the rights of each person, as each one desires to be respected. It extends as well to the fulfillment of obligations towards family, society and authority, just as much as for individuals in general.”						
					</blockquote>

						<h3>How Spiritisim Defines Ethics</h3>
					</header>

					<p>Spiritisim’s definition of Ethics has aspects found in the basic concepts of all three of Philosophical ethics schools of thought.</p>
					<p>Dates back to the ancient Greek thinkers and is thus the oldest type of ethical theory in Western philosophy. Plato discussed four key virtues: wisdom, courage, temperance and justice.</p>
					<p>Virtue-based ethical theories focus on helping people develop good character traits, such as kindness and generosity. These character traits will, in turn, allow a person to make the correct decisions later on in life. Virtue theorists also emphasize the need for people to learn how to break bad habits of character, like greed or anger</p>
					<p>Spiritism teaches that a major part of a persons spiritual evolution comes about by changes in conduct. Virtues like empathy, charity, indulgence , humility, and love are vital to achieving a higher level of existence. Without these virtues (along with intellectual progress) a person can never achieve their true potential.					</p>

						<h3>Conclusion</h3>
					</header>
					<p>In conclusion Spiritism defines ethics as being the application of possitive changes in conduct, keeping true to an honest intent, learning about actions and their consequences and an undertsnading of universal law. All the concepts put forth by Spirit teachers in the 1850s-70s are part of modern philosophical study today.</p>

						<h3>Summary</h3>
					</header>
					<p>Spiritisim provides us, not just with an understanding of ethics, but of how we apply ethics in our individual lives, and how our ignorance is reflected in the limitations of our ethical code. It explains the natural laws that govern the Spirit world (universal laws) and how they influence our reincarnations here on earth. It clarifies how we choose trials to force ourselves to modify our conduct. And why applying the ethical lessons found in the teachings of Socrates and Plato, ,the example of Jesus of Nazareth, amoung many others and the suggestions of the Spirit teachers are a way to evolve faster and avoid many painful trials.</p>
