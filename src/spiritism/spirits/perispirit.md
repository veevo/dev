## The Perispirit
The perispirit, a semi-material envelope that survives the body and accompanies the spirit in all states, uniting it to the material body when the spirit is incarnated, is crucial to the understanding the nature and operation of the spirit. It has many important functions in the spirits' interaction with the spiritual and material worlds, as well as its own evolution. You can read more about it by reading the subsection entitled "The Perispirit, or Spirit Body", found on the menu at left.
