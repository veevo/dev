## Introduction
José Herculano Pires was born in Avaré, state of São Paulo, Brazil on 25 September, 1914, and died in the city of São Paulo on 9 March, 1979. He translated the works of Allan Kardec and wrote both philosophical treatises and literary texts on the spiritist doctrine, including 81 treatises in philosophy, history, psychology, pedagogy, parapsychology, and spiritism, some of which with Francisco Xavier as a coauthor. Most of his works are dedicated to the study and propagation of the spiritist doctrine. He was one of the most active and consistent followers of Spiritism in Brazil.

Perhaps his most important contribution was the relentless pursuit to demonstrate the self-consistency of the spiritist thought, its consequent defense and valuing of the critical and investigative aspect of the doctrine. Readers of his works soon realize his immense concern with poor translations and interpretations of the works of Allan Kardec, particularly those that emerged from within the Brazilian Spiritist Movement in the XX century. In a spiritual communication through the medium Francisco Xavier, the spirit Emmanuel stated that "José Herculano Pires was the standard that best measured Allan Kardec’s works."

Professor José Herculano Pires wrote 81 books about philosophical studies and literary compositions inspired by Spiritism. His main concern was always to strive to demonstrate the consistency of the spiritist thought and to defend the value of the critical and investigative aspects of the work codified by Allan Kardec.
