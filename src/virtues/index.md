## Introduction

Virtue-based ethical theories focus on helping people develop good character traits, such as [kindness](kindness) and [generosity](generosity). These character traits will, in turn, allow a person to make the correct decisions later on in life. Virtue theorists also emphasize the need for people to learn how to break bad habits of character, like [greed](greed) or [anger](anger)

Dates back to the ancient Greek thinkers and is thus the oldest type of ethical theory in Western philosophy. **Plato discussed four key virtues**: [wisdom](wisdom), [courage](courage), [temperance](temperance) and [justice](justice).

[Spiritism](/spiritism) teaches that a major part of a persons spiritual evolution comes about by changes in conduct. Virtues like [empathy](empathy), [charity](charity), [indulgence](indulgence) , [humility](humility), and [love](love) are vital to achieving a higher level of existence. Without these virtues (along with intellectual progress) a person can never achieve their true potential.
