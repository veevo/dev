## About the book

The Genesis: Miracles and Predictions Explained by the Spiritist Doctrine (La Genèse: Les Miracles Et Les Prédictions Selon Le Spiritisme in the original French) was published 1868, just before Kardec’s death. This volume divided into three main sections, not just tries to find common ground between science and religion, and dispel the myth of miracles (the supernatural), but also delvs into important scientific and philosophical topics within Spitritism.

### Part One
Part one “Genesis” deals with subjects in spiritisim such as God, good , evil, and the Spiritist view of the biblical genesis. Subjects of science as understood in 1868, relating to the origins of the universe, ancient and modern systems of the world, a study of space and time, geologic design of the Earth, theories about the Earth’s formation, global revolutions, organic genesis, and spiritual genesis.

### Part Two
Part two “Miracles”, discusses how, as with all other previously unexplained phenomena in human history, what in biblical times were referred to as miracles were actually natural occurrences governed by natural laws only now understood through Spiritism. The section delt with subjects such as: the characteristics of so called miracles, spiritual fluids and their role in such phenomena, and the miracles of the 4 Gospels.

### Part Three
Part three “Predictions” discusses premonitions of future events, the predictions of the Gospels, and the characteristics and implications of the coming evolution of this Earthly plain

In spite of the fact that the Spirit Teachers, like with other revelations in history, were tempered by the very limited scientific understandings of the era, much of what was revealed to Kardec in 1868 predicts later scientific discoveries:

> … it is astonishing how few of the spirits’ ‘scientific’ statements appear anachronistic today. In fact, some of the answers to Rivail’s questions could be interpreted as being remarkably ahead of their time. One such example was Rivail’s question ‘Does an absolute void exist in any part of space?’ which received the reply:- ‘No, there is no void. What appears like a void to you is occupied by matter in a state in which it escapes the action of your senses and of your instruments.’ This statement (given in the 1860’s), to the effect that seemingly empty space is really full of matter, has only received confirmation quite recently by the discovery of what is termed the ‘quantum vacuum’, and was given shortly after the spirits had also casually announced that ‘…what you term a molecule [or, perhaps, ‘particle’ or ‘atom’] is still very far from being the elementary molecule’. This latter scientific fact would not be confirmed until J.J. Thomson discovered the electron almost half a century later. “
