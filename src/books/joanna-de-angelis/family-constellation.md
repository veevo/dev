## Description
The direction society takes is invariably connected to the destiny of the family, given that the latter consists of the starting point for experiences of universal fraternity. In this beautiful work composed of thirty themes, Joanna de Ângelis offers a profound reflection about the mechanism of the spiritual and moral development of human beings, emphasizing the value of the family through corporeal and spiritual ties whose existence is still one of the most important factors, if not the most significant one, in preventing disintegration of society.

The venerable Joanna de Ângelis offers distinguished reflections about the family constellation, presenting the firm position of Spiritism on a theme that is unfortunately disregarded rather often in our chaotic modern world, and one which has led to a deterioration of social behavior into egotism and violence, as evidenced by their consequences to society, a situation that leaves all of us perplexed and powerless.
