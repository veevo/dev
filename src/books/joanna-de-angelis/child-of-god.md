## Description
> "This pocket book is intended for your difficult hours; for those uncertain and helpless moments that all of us meet. You will find the help that you need in its pages. Some themes may already be known to you, dear reader, but even so we want to bring them back into your mind, so that they may uplift you, and help you to move on towards your spiritual goal."
