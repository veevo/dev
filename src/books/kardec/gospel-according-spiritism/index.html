				<header><h2>About <strong>The Gospel according to Spiritist</strong></h2></header>
				<p>
					Published in 1865 with a second edition coming out the next year, The Gospel Explained By The Spiritist Doctrine/ aka The Gospel According To Spiritism (Le Evangile Selon Le Spiritisme in the original french) was Kardec’s reply to those who claimed that Spiritism was anti christian. In this volume Kardec, after much study of the origins of Christianity, begins by explaining that only by understanding the Middle eastern culture of 2000 years ago can the meaning of the teachings of
					<a href="/about/jesus">Jesus</a> be understood as they were intended. A revolutionary point of view only in recent decades adopted by scientists who study the bible and biblical times.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Each section of this volume starts with a biblical passage and then Kardec provides logical, rational explanations of the timeless ethical lessons intended by Jesus, and reflecting the teachings of Spiritism. The sections also include instructions and messages of hope by Superior Spirits like those who’s wisdom is found in the other volumes of the codification.

					Miguel Bertolucci writes (in the preface to the 2000 edition, translated and published by Allan Kardec Educational Society: 
					<blockquote>
						<p>
						“The core message [this book] presents transcends time and religious form, as Allan Kardec carefully chose passages from the Gospel that deal exclusively with moral matters and timeless truths. In doing so he deliberately avoided what might be interpreted as circumstantial to the Jewish nation and customers. These scripture excerpts became the basis for the explanations provided by the Spirits, and the explications by Allan Kardec, himself.</p>
						
						<p>This is therefore a book that invites the reader to ponder her or his life through the vivid accounts from those who have already mastered their lessons, and the reflections of those who were willing to reevaluate their own past experiences on Earth. This is what makes the Gospel a true guide for our own inner transformation, and for engaging the self in the discovery of each person’s true purpose in life.”</p>
