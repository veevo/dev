				<header><h2><strong>The Gospel according to Spiritist</strong> | Main Concepts</h2></header>
				<p>
					Some of the main concepts presented by this book.
				</p>

				<p>The revelation of God is continuous because mankind is slowly evolving to a higher level (the Law Of Progress) , making it necessary to perfect the doctrine. The first revelation was through Moses, the second through Christ (though it was previously tried in Greece with Socrates but failed), and the third one was from God himself through his messengers the Spirit teachers).</p>
				<p>Spirits are immortal and live many lives (reincarnations) to obtain ethical and intelligence growth. Eventually evolving beyond the need of Earthly reincarnations, and eventually evolving to the point where they are able to be in the presence of God.</p>
				<p>Every one of the revelations (Moses, Jesus , Spiritism) elaborates on the previous, instead of revoking it.</p>
				<p>Ethical growth is based on an understanding of non-carnal, unconditional Love, while intellectual growth is based on understanding why & how.</p>
				<p>Nothing is truly learned until it is put to practice countless times (through reincarnations), only then does it become an instinctual response in the student.</p>
				<p>Charity (the practice) of love must not seek personal gain of any kind. .</p>
				<p>Mediumship gifts must be shared freely, without personal gain.</p>
				<p>Marriage is not indissoluble, if there is no agreement any more, this proves that God never united the couple.</p>
				<p>Salvation is by action and learning only, no single ritual or religious institution can take the place of the slow ethical and intellectual evolution necessary to reunite us with God.</p>
