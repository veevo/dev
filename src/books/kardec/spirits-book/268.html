							<h3>268. Until a spirit has reached the state of perfect purity, has he constantly to undergo trials?</h3>
						</header>
						
						<p>
							“Yes; but not such as you understand by that term. By the term trials, you understand only material tribulations. But when a spirit has reached a certain degree of purification, although he is not yet perfect, he has no more tribulations of that kind to undergo. He has, nevertheless, to perform creating duties which advance his own improvement, but there is nothing painful in these, as, for example, the duty of aiding others to work out their own improvement.”
