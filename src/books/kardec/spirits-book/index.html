				<header><h2>About <strong>The Spirits Book</strong></h2></header>
				<p>
					The Spirits’ Book <i>("Le Livre des Esprits" in its original French title)</i> was published on April 18, 1857. The
					book was structured as a collection of FAQs, grouped by theme, occasionally interrupted by lengthier articles on
					specific subjects.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Because Rivail was an experienced educator and writer he managed to present a large amount of
					information in a way that was and continues to be easily understood by the adept and casual reader alike. It was
					so successful that a second edition, augmented with yet more material, was printed the following year and the name
					<a href="/authors/allan-kardec/">Alan Kardec</a> became a household word all over the continent.</p>
				
				<p>
					The publication of The Spirits’ Book caused something such a sensation in France not least because its ‘author’ was a sober, respected intellectual, but also because it contained ‘spirit communications’ that answered his questions in relation to every subject from the internal structure of matter to the nature of God, human ethics, the universe and the place of humankind within
					it. Indeed, the contents of The Spirits’ Book was probably not the sort of stuff that the public had been led to
					expect from the mediumship craze that had, over the space of only nine years, swept across
					<a href="/spiritism/history">America and Europe</a> after being initiated by two children!”
