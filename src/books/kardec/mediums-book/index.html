				<header><h2>About <strong>The Mediums Book</strong></h2></header>
				<p>
					Encouraged by the success of <a href="/books/kardec/spirits-book/">The Spirits’ Book</a>,
					Rivail published <strong>The Mediums’ Book</strong> (Le Livre des Médiums, in French) in 1861. That book dealt solely with the Spirits’ views on the development and uses of mediumship itself. For this and the other works that would follow, he used even more mediums than for The Spirits’ Book but he employed the same method of presentation i.e., his questions followed by the spirits’ answers which were supplemented by his own comments and observations.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Allan Kardec describes the book (in Le Revue Spirite (Spiritist Journal) 1861 ) as such:
					
					<blockquote>“It constitutes the complement to “The Spirits’ Book” and contains the experimental piece of Spiritism, just as the latter contains the philosophic piece. In this work, fruit of a long experience of laborious studies, we sought to clarify all the questions tied to the practice of the manifestations. In agreement with the Spirit teachings, it contains the theoretic explanation of the diverse phenomena and of the conditions in which they are produced. But the section pertaining to the development and exercise of mediumship was, on our part, was a topic of particular attention and focus.”
					</blockquote>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Most importantly the work deals with not just the technical details of the phenomena and devolopment of a medium but also with the even more important details on the ethical development and practice critical for the use of a mediumship gift and in the life of any Spiritist in general.
