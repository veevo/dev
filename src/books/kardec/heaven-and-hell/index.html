				<header><h2>About <strong>Heaven and Hell</strong></h2></header>
				<p>
					Heaven and Hell (Le Ciel et l’Enfer the original French title) was published on 1865. It is divided into two parts named “The Doctrine” and “The Examples”. The fist part explains the different view Spiritism has on the subject, stating that both “Heaven” (i.e. happiness in the after-life) and “Hell” (i.e. punishment in the after-life) are misconceptions, that the state of the spirits after their death is not definitive and that there is always hope, even for the crudest criminal. The second part is a series of interviews with spirits of deceased people, exemplifying the working truth of the doctrine previously detailed.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The book was not only a description by the spirit teachers of the real nature of these states (in the spirit world), it also included communications from recently deceased spirits from all moral classes…from the most evil, to the most blameless and charitable. Each type of personality described their current conditions and how their actions on Earth had contributed to their current joys or sorrows.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Contrary to the dogmas of the Catholic church which painted a picture of never ending suffering even for those whose only sin was not to be Catholic, the Spirit communicators maintained that suffering in the next life only lasts until the individual has made the necessary effort to rectify the cause, and that everyone is given an opportunity to achieve this.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the case of a recently executed murderer… ‘a systematic poisoner, a physician who had employed his professional position as a means to the accomplishment of the long tissue of horrible murders for which he had just been executed’. This man, upon manifesting spontaneously at a seance, and despite complaining that ‘Light dazzles and pierces, like sharp arrows, the innermost recesses of my being’, contemptuously turned away from the help offered by the circle… ‘I reject your pity…I ask for nothing…I suffice to myself; and I shall be able to resist this odious light’. Rivail states, however, that this spirit, eventually began to improve, repented and became the author of ‘many wise and good communications’.56 Other murderers described a state of confusion and a terror at the prospect of meeting their victims. One who had told how this had actually happened to him described why it caused him such suffering:-
				</p>
				
				<blockquote>
					Q. ‘What do you feel on seeing them?’<br>
					A. ‘Shame and remorse…and I hate them still…They pray that I may expiate my crimes. You cannot imagine what a horrible torture it is to owe everything to those we hate.’57
				</blockquote>
				
				<p>
				There were also communications from many other types of spiritual miscreant. Some, although they had committed no evil during their lives, had achieved nothing good either and expressed remorse at this. Others who had been blatantly greedy expressed their desire to give in some way. Conversely, those who had led good lives described their relative happiness and the hope that they may continue to be of service to others in their new life.58

				Allan Kardec wrote, in Le Revue Spirite (Spiritist Journal) of September 1865:
				</p>

				<blockquote>
					“The title of this work clearly indicates its objective. There, we compiled all the elements needed to enlighten man about his destiny. As in our other writings about the Spiritist Doctrine, we have introduced no product of any preconceived system or of any personal notion, which would have no authority. Everything there is deduced from observation and agreement of facts.”
