## Bibliography
Manoel Philomeno de Miranda was a physician born in Conde, state of Bahia, Brazil on November 14, 1876 and died in the city of Salvador, capital of the same state, on July 14, 1942. He was introduced to Spiritism in 1914 by the medium Saturnino Favila and later became a member of the União Espírita Baiana ("Spiritist Union of Bahia"), now Federação Espírita do Estado da Bahia ("Spiritist Federation of the State of Bahia"), which was founded in 1915. He worked as a coordinator at mediumistic meetings and from 1921 until his death, he became an active member in the board of directors of UEB. Under a pseudonym, he published many works in defense of the Spiritist Doctrine. In 1950, 8 years after his death, the Brazilian medium Francisco C. Xavier psychographed a message signed by Manoel Philomeno de Miranda to another Brazilian medium, Divaldo P. Franco. However, it was not until 1970 that the spirit of Manoel Philomeno de Miranda would start to dictate public works by the hand of the medium Divaldo P. Franco, particularly in the area of disobsession, which had been his work during his physical life. This partnership brought to the public several works, especially on the theme of obsession, which focused on broadening our understanding of the topic and provided support for other mediumistic work developed at many other spiritist centers in Brazil.
