## Introduction
Through philosophical thought and exploration, man seeks to answer the great questions of life:  Who are we?  Where do we come from?  What is our Purpose?  Where are we going?  Spiritism addresses all those questions in its rational and uplifting philosophy, a philosophy grounded in scientific study and logical thought.  Spiritist philosophy not only satisfies our insatiable desire for the answers to these questions, but also arms us with wisdom for defense against life's struggles and with a moral framework for the achievement of progress and the attainment of true happiness.
