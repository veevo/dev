Veevo.org is an independent organization. We don't host ads on this site, we don't and we won't ever get any financial benefit from it.

Our mission is different: we expect to provide light to the human being through the teachings of Spiritism.

Spiritism is not someone's work. It's the doctrine of the Spirits. It's the Comforter promissed by Jesus  (John, 14: 15-17 & 26). Its mission is to revive His Doctrine so much misinterpreted, distorted, misunderstood and ignored by the humanity for over 2000 years.

## Content
While we build some content ourselves, we also publish other authors on this site. When we do it, we strive to provide the original source, author name and, if in case of a book, the book name and additional information.

In case one of these articles is yours or violates copyright, feel free to contact us and we will be happy to remove.

## Downloadable Content
We strive to only link to free material for download. Since most of the work available trough this site was made by superior Spirits or by Mediums are free or have no distribution restrictions, we freely distribute them. However, if any of that content violates any copyright, feel free to contact us and we will be happy to remove.

## Videos
As previously stated on the download section, we only link to videos hosted on public video platforms (usually YouTube). In case any of that content is copyrighted, please contact the owner directly on that channel. In dout, don't hesitate to contact us for questions.

## Errors
While we review every content and validate against the Spiritist Doctrine, sometimes we make mistakes. If you spot one, feel free to report it to us using one of the channels available to do so.
