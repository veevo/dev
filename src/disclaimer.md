Veevo.org is an independent, privacy-focused, completely volunteered developed and run organization. We don't host ads, we don't get any financial benefit and we will never will.
We believe that being a [zero-profit organization](/pillars/no-profit) provides a solid foundation to reach our goals.

Our mission is different: we expect to provide light to the human being through the teachings of [Spiritism](/spiritism).

Spiritism is not someone's work. It's the doctrine of the Spirits. It's [the Comforter promissed by Jesus](/messages/jesus/John, 14:15-17 & 26).
Spiritism's mission is to revive Jesus' Doctrine so much misinterpreted, distorted, misunderstood and ignored by the humanity for over 2000 years.

## Content
We believe in [Education](/pillars/education). While we build some content ourselves, we also publish content from other authors on this site. For content not authored by us, we strive to provide the original source, author name, access date and additional information when applicable. To report errors, please check the _Removal of Content_ section for more details.

## Translations
Our mission is to divulge Spiritism to as many people as possible _in the world_. That means translating content to and from different languages. Due to the size of the team, we often recur to automated translation. Before going live however, every content is revised but errors may still occurr. The [Openness](/pillars/openness) pillars guarantees that readers should be able to report and fix errors when applicable.

## Privacy
We are an independent, privacy-focused, completely volunteered developed and run organization. We don't host ads, we don't get any financial benefit and we will never will.

The stated above also applies to videos posted on this site. All links point to videos hosted on public video platforms (YouTube et al). In case any of that content is copyrighted, please contact the owner directly on that channel. In dout, don't hesitate to [contact us](/contact) for questions.

## Errors
