So you would like to share our content. How should you do it? On this post, we provide
some general guidance on how to share our content with the world. But first, let's understand why
it's important to share, when you can.

## Why
Why should you share this content? And why it's important?

Simply because we think that this content, when correctly applied, can change the human being.
Our motto is _[know thyself](/about/know-thyself)_ because we believe 
that this is the only way to achieve the [true happiness](/about/happiness).

So, would you like to make those around you happier? Would you like to help them overcoming
difficult challanges like [depression](/about/depression), [suicidal tendencies](/about/suicide)
or even, divulge the fact that we're all [immortal spirits](/about/immortal-spirit)?
