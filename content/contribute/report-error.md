We strongly believe on [Education](/pillars/education). We only publish content from primarily trusted authors
that respect and honor the [Spiritist Doctrine](/spiritism) and the [Gospel](/gospel) faithfully. However, errors may happen.

Our volunteers are engaged on reviewing and validating every published content however, we can't guarantee that no errors exist.
Found an error? Keep reading to understand how to proceed.


## Types of Errors
The following types of erros are the most common: translation, typos, source and content.
Below, we describe what they are and how can you help.

### Translation Error
Translation errors are the most common. They happen because every published material 
has to be translated and sometimes the translator misunderstood the original excerpt.
However, please notice that for now, we rely solely on our volunteers
to translate the massive amount of content we serve.

Due to the scale of data that we serve, and to the fact that some of the translators are not native or fluent
on the language translated, it's possible that errors will exist.

In order to report a translation error, please [contact us](/help/contact-us).

### Typos
Typos are common too and you're much welcome to report us by [contacting us](/help/contact-us).

### Missing or Invalid Source
Whenever possible we expose the original source and, if necessary, translation information so our users can validate that using other sources.
However, on some circumstances, a given content may lack the minimum information (Book Name, Author and/or Source Url).

In order to report a missing source/translation, please [contact us](/help/contact-us).

### Content Errors
We only import content from reliable authors and reliable sources. In case you spot an error,
don't hesitate in [dropping us a note](/help/contact-us).

### Other Types of Errors
For every other type of error, please [contact us](/help/contact-us).
