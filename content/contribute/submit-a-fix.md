Veevo.org is an organization that welcomes contributions. In fact, we run and host most of our
services on open repositories (as stated on our [Openness](/help/pillars/#openness) pillar).
We also invite contributions at different levels such as [translations](/contribute/translate),
[errors](/contribute/report-error) and more.

## How to submit a fix
For now, we are only accepting contributions via the [contact us page](/help/contact-us).

In the future, we will engage our volunteers on a more streamlined workflow. Keep an eye on this
page as it will be updated as soon as the new model went live.

Thanks for your help!
