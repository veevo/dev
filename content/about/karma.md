Karma [from Sanskrit: karmam ] - 

1. In Hindu philosophies, the whole of men's actions and their consequences. 

2. A word borrowed from Hindu doctrines which, in spiritism, has become vulgarized as the 
equivalent of the law of cause and effect, also called the law of action and reaction, 
the law of return, the law of causality, but without that content of unalterability found 
in its original meaning, since Spiritism incorporates, by its side, the law of mercy 
or of compensations, by which the good acts can soften or neutralize effects of the bad acts 
of this or previous existences.
