The return to a new body through reincarnation occurs for the growth of the
spirit. It is an educational process, not a punitive one.

In general, reincarnations are planned in advance, whose preparation time will
be commensurate with the educational needs of the spirit. The more evolved the
spirit, the longer its time of intermission, consequently the more time it will
have for its planning. The planning will require the concurrence of many
spirits, who will participate, directly or indirectly, in the future relations
of the reincarnant. Such preparations range from the choice of parents to the
type and details of the body that the spirit will use. We choose the kind of
evidence that will be crossed, the type of death that will have, the main
experiences that will occur after birth, what reunions will occur, what
diseases will have, what is the most favorable time to reincarnate, etc.

Such planned experiences occur at the level of probabilities, and there may be
changes depending on the needs of the spirit, as well as its free will and
third parties. Fundamental is to realize that while the fate and existence of
the internal pressure of past experiences are planned, free will is sovereign
and can change any of those factors. Any choices that are different from those
planned will lead to consequences - positive or negative - for the spirit. The
spirit, after reincarnation, may alter its planning. He may acquire new
commitments, such as running away from others. You can extend your anticipated
achievements as much as decrease them.

Life on earth is no longer a fluke but a goal. Each human action has
implications, for nothing happens by chance. It does not return to earth like a
vacation camp. Earth is not an instance of leisure. To live is to build for the
spirit. To be in the physical body is to become aware of the responsibility for
various learning processes that the universe provides.

Here it is for something to learn. One should not despise the social world or
the body, for even though the spiritual reality is the generating matrix, it is
not exclusive and should not contribute to alienation from the world of living
sayings. There is a complementarity between material and spiritual life. To
live outside the physical world is to know how to live in it.
