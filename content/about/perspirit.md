Perispirit [from Latin peri = around + spiritus= spirit] - Semimaterial shell
of the Spirit after its separation from the body.  In the incarnate, it serves
as a bond or intermediary between Spirit and matter. 

The Spirit takes you from the world you are in and changes you as you move from
one to another. It is more or less subtle or crude, depending on the nature of
each globe. The perispirit can take all forms at will of the Spirit; ordinarily
he assumes the image that he had in his last bodily existence. 

Although ethereal in nature, the substance of the perispirit is susceptible to
certain modifications that make it perceptible to us. 

This is what happens in the apparitions. It may even, by its union with the
fluid of certain people, become temporarily tangible, that is, offer to the
touch the resistance of a solid body, as seen in stereological or palpable
apparitions. 

The perispirit is,to the Spirit what the perisperm is to the germ of the fruit.
The almond, stripped of its woody casing, encloses the germ under the delicate
perisperm casing.

## What is the perispirit?
[Spirit](/about/spirits) [incarnated](/about/incarnation) in a [material body](/about/physical-body). The [perispirit](/about/perispirit)
is the semi-material body that unites the Spirit to the physical body.

In addition to the corporeal world inhabited by incarnate Spirits, which are Human Beings, there exists the spiritual world, inhabited by discarnate Spirits.

As described on The Mediums Book, the Perispirit is

> a semi-material envelope part of the ‘spirit’. The perispirit is the part of the spirit that can be modified and changed in order for a spirit to be able to act upon its environment. The term Perispirit is from the Greek, meaning Outer Spirit or Around the Spirit. The perispirit has roughly the same appearance of the spirits’ last incarnation and is what we actually see in apparitions. 

After [discarnating](/about/discarnation), the [spirit](/about/spirit) gives up only the material body, 
keeping the perispirit which is a kind of ethereal body, vaporous and very subtle to us. 
It has the human form which seems to be the standard one. In its normal state, the perispirit is invisible, 
but the spirit can make certain changes upon it so as to render it temporarily visible or able to be 
touched, similar to what happens to condensed vapor.

In this manner, the spirits can sometimes appear to us during apparitions.
