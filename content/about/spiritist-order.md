Spiritist Scale - A chart of the different orders of spirits, indicating the degrees 
they have to go through to reach perfection as moral feelings and intellectual ideas 
progress. It comprises three main orders: the imperfect spirits, the good spirits and the 
pure spirits. 

These classes are not distinct species, and all spirits are called to follow them successively, 
that is, from ignorance to the state of perfection. 

Within the spiritist scale, the spirits can park, but never back down.
