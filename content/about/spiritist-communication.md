Spiritist Communication - Intelligent manifestation of spirits, having as its
object a continuous exchange of thought between them and men. They are
distinguished in: 

a) frivolous - futile and unimportant matters; b) rude - translated by
expressions that offend decency; c) serious - exclude frivolity, whatever the
subject matter; d) instructional - objectify the teaching of the spirits about
the sciences, morals, philosophy, etc. 

For the modality, see Sematology, Typology, Psychography, Pneumatography,
Psychophony, Pneumatophony, Pictography, Telepathy or Telegraphy.
