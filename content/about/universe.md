## Introduction
Within the Universe there are other inhabited worlds, with beings at different degrees of evolution: some equal, others more or less evolved than Human Beings.  
The spirit-world is the normal, original, eternal world; it is pre-existent to and survives everything else.  
The physical world is secondary.  It could cease to exist, or even have never existed at all, and that would not affect the essence of the spirit-world.
