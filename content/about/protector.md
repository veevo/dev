Protector [from Latin protectore ] - 

It is the [good Spirit](../superior-spirit) who has accepted the mission of 
accompanying and helping the progress of his protégé, influencing with his advice, 
comforting his afflictions, sustaining his courage in the trials of life. 

It attaches to the individual from birth to biological death and often follows 
it later in the spiritual life, and even in various bodily existences.
