## Definition
Matter - Link that holds the Spirit and the body.  Agent, intermediary with the
help of which the Spirit acts.

Generally speaking, matter is:
* That which occupies space and has mass; physical substance.
* A type of such substance.
* Discharge or waste, such as pus or feces, from a living organism.

According to [Spiritism](/spiritism), matter derives from the universal fluid
are in the solid, liquid, gaseous, and fluidic state itself, also called the
spiritual fluid, so that while the first three can be manipulated by the hand
of man, the latter is sensitive. 

In [material worlds](/about/material-world), matter is essentially everything
that compose those worlds, including atoms, fluids (such as electric) and other
subtle parcticles.

## Advanced Concepts
From the human point of view, matter is generally conceived of as something that
occupies space, can be perceived by one or more senses, and is impenetrable.
However matter exists in states unknown to us even if being too ethereal to
make an impression on our senses.

The other key point to understand about matter is that it is formed of one
basic element.  The elements that we regard as basic (such as hydrogen,
oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, and their chemical/physical building blocks) are
really transformations of a more fundamental matter: the cosmic fluid. 

Basically, matter has only two essential properties: force and movement. All
other properties conditioned by intensity, direction, and movement, are only
secondary effects responding to different molecular arrangements.  These
secondary effects, such as flavors, colors, sounds, poisonous vs. medicinal
qualities, etc., occur when elementary molecules undergo changes due to the
interaction and combination with other molecules, or in response to
environmental pressure.

Any of that is new and all of it has already been proven by science. However,
what science has yet to prove is that the minimum particle already found is
still very far from being the most elementary element.
