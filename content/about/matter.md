Generally speaking, matter is:
* That which occupies space and has mass; physical substance.
* A type of such substance.
* Discharge or waste, such as pus or feces, from a living organism.

Matter according to [Spiritism](/spiritism), derives from 
the universal fluid are in the solid, liquid, gaseous, and 
fluidic state itself, also called the spiritual fluid, so that while the first 
three can be manipulated by the hand of man, the latter is sensitive. 

In [material worlds](/about/material-world), matter is essentially
everything that compose those worlds, including atoms, fluids (such as electric)
and other subtle parcticles.
