Reincarnation [from the Latin re + incarnatione ] - 

1. Return of the Spirit to the corporeal life, in a new body specially formed for him. 
It is progressive or stationary, never retrograde. 

2. One of the personalities of the Spirit within the plurality of their existences. 

## When does the reincarnation occur?
Reincarnation can occur immediately after death, or after a longer or shorter period 
of time, during which the Spirit remains wandering. 

It may be on this earth or in other spheres, but always in a human body, never in an animal's. 

Reincarnation is progressive or stationary; It is never retrograde. 
In his new bodily existences the Spirit may fall into social position, but not as 
Spirit, that is, from lord he may be born servant, prince, craftsman, rich, miserable, 
but always progressing in science and morality. 

In this way the criminal can become a good man, but the good man cannot become a criminal. Imperfect spirits, who are still under the influence of matter, do not always have perfect ideas about reincarnation.Their explanation resents their ignorance and terrestrial prejudices, somewhat as one would with a peasant who wondered if the earth or the sun is spinning. They have only a confused memory of their previous existences and the future is extremely vague to them (It is known that the memory of past existences is elucidated as the Spirit purifies itself). Some even speak of the concentric spheres surrounding the earth in which the gradually rising Spirit reaches the seventh heaven, which is for them the heyday of perfection. But in the midst of the diversity of expressions and the extravagance of figures, a careful observation easily recognizes a dominant thought, that of the successive trials that the Spirit must suffer,and of the varying degrees which it must go through to attain perfection and supreme happiness. Many times things only seem contradictory to us because we do not probe into their inner meaning.

## Why reincarnate?
The return to a new body through reincarnation occurs for the growth of the spirit. 
It is an educational process, not a punitive one. 

There is no definite number of incarnations for a spirit but, the more effort one does,
the fastest they evolve and less they suffer.

## Life on Earth
Understanding reincarnation is important because it explains why life on earth is 
not a fluke but a goal. Each human action has implications, 
for nothing happens by chance. Life on Earth should not be treated like a vacation camp. 
Earth is not an instance of leisure. To live is to build for the spirit. 

Being in the physical body is becoming aware of the responsibility for the various 
learning processes that the universe provides.
