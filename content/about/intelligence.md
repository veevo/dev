Related to: Intelligent [Latin intelligentia ]

Faculty of conceiving, understanding and reasoning.  It would be unfair to
refuse animals a kind of intelligence and to believe that they merely follow
the blind impulse of instinct mechanically. 

Their intelligence is always limited to the satisfaction of material needs,
while man's intelligence allows him to rise above the condition of humanity. 

The line of demarcation between animals and man is drawn by the knowledge given
to him of the Supreme Being.

Intelligent - [from Latin intelligente ]. That has the faculty of
understanding. Clever; skillful; shrewd.
