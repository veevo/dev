All of us, [Immortal Spirits](/about/immortal-spirit) will live many, many incarnations.
Which means we all already had many existences and will still have many others on this world (and others)
until we reach perfection.

It is trough these multiple incarnations that our Spirits develop their moral and intellectual
knowledges, necessary to their development.

The incarnation of spirits only takes place in human beings.  Spirits do not incarnate in animal form.  

The chain of incarnations is always progressive.  The spirit's speed of progress depends on its efforts, but it cannot regress.   

An incarnate spirit is under the influence of matter.  Those who surmount this influence, through self-purification, raise themselves nearer to the higher spheres.  Those who give in to instinctual tendencies and pursue solely the gratification of physical desires are closer to the inferior realm.  

Incarnated spirits live on different worlds throughout the universe.   

Free (or not incarnated) spirits do not occupy a circumscribed space.  They are found everywhere, and they both perceive and regularly associate with human beings.  They constitute an invisible but active society that constantly interacts with our own.
