According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue):

Virtue (Latin: virtus, Ancient Greek: ἀρετή "arete") is moral excellence. 

A virtue is a trait or quality that is deemed to be morally good and thus is
valued as a foundation of principle and good moral being. Personal virtues are
characteristics valued as promoting collective and individual greatness. In
other words, it is a behavior that shows high moral standards. Doing what is
right and avoiding what is wrong. 

The opposite of virtue is [vice](../vice).
