## Suicide according to Spiritism
According to [Spiritism], the suicide is a terrible mistake because it is a false door.

As soon as the person performs the act of suicide, they realize the precipice that 
opens before him.

In general, suicides suffer the most after death.

It is because when they arrive in the spirit world they realize that they have not achieved the intention, which was to end their life.

They continue to live and realize that the problems they wanted to escape from are added by their lack of faith in God and their rebellion.

In natural death the bonds that bind the Spirit to the body are slowly untied, while by suicide they are violently broken, but without allowing the Spirit to break free.
