Mediumship [from Latin medium + -ity ] - 1. Faculty that almost all people
have, some more and less, of feeling the influence or the communication of the
Spirits, so much so that Allan Kardec claims that those who have no rudiments
of mediumship. 2. In some, this faculty is overt and needs to be disciplined,
educated; in others it remains latent and may manifest episodically and
eventually. See: mediumness .
