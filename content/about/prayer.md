Prayer [from Latin Prayer ] -

It is an invocation and in some cases an evocation by which we call such or such a 
Spirit. When addressed to God, He sends us His messengers, the Good Spirits. 

Prayer cannot revoke the decrees of Providence; but through it the Good Spirits 
can come to our aid, either to give us the moral strength we lack or to suggest the 
necessary thoughts: hence comes the relief we experience when we pray fervently. 

Hence also comes the relief that suffering spirits experience when we pray for them; 
they themselves ask these prayers in the form that is familiar to them and more in 
keeping with their retained ideas of their bodily existence. 
Reason, according to what the spirits themselves say, tells us that the prayer of lips 
is a vain formula when the heart does not take part in it.

## Talking to God
Prayer is an act of adoration for [God](/about/god). It is found in the natural law 
and is the result of an innate sentiment in every Human Being, just as the idea of the existence of the Creator is innate.

## Making us better
Prayer makes [Human Beings](/about/human-being) better. Whoever prays with fervor and confidence grows stronger against evil temptations, and God sends the Good [Spirits](/about/spiritss) to assist them. This type of assistance will never be denied when requested with sincerity.
