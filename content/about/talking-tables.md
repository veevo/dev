Talking tables (or rotating tables, talking tables or dancing tables) 
are a kind of spiritist session in which participants sit around a table, 
put their hands on it and wait for it to move.

Very popular phenomenon in the nineteenth century, it was believed that tables served 
as a means of communication with supposed spirits.

It was the phenomenon that attracted [Allan Kardec](/bio/allan-kardec) attention that, 
by witnessing them, resolved to deepen the study of the issues involved with 
spirituality.
