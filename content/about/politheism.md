Polytheism [Greek polus = various + théos = God] - 
Religion that admits various gods. Among ancient peoples the word god reveals the idea 
of power; to them all power exceeding the vulgar was a god. Even the men who had done 
great things became gods to them. 

Spirits manifesting themselves through effects that seemed to them supernatural, 
were in their eyes so many deities, among which it is impossible to fail to recognize 
spirits of all grades, from scouts to higher spirits. 

Knowledge of the manifestations of spirits is therefore the source of polytheism. 
However, from the highest antiquity, enlightened men gave these would-be gods their 
due value and recognized in them creatures of a supreme God, sovereign and lord of 
the world.
