Telegraphy - [from the Greek têle + graphé ]. System that transmits graphic signals at a distance.

## Human telegraphy
Communication at a distance between two living persons, which evoke each other. 

This evocation causes the emancipation of the soul, or the incarnate Spirit, which 
comes to manifest and can communicate its thought by writing or by any other means. 

The spirits tell us that human telegraphy will one day be a usual means of communication, 
when men are more moralized, less selfish and less attached to material things. 

Until this state is reached, human telegraphy will be a privilege of the souls of the 
school.
