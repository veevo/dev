## Introduction
The two main forces of the [Universe](/about/universe) are: [Spirit](/about/immortal-spirit) and [matter](/about/matter).
You can read more about these forces and their relationships on this site.

But what is our body, how is it generated and what it serves?

### Our Body
Our body is simply the _material envelope_ that a Spirit _temporarely_ utilizes. By _temporarely_ we mean
"during the existing life of an incarnated spirit."

### What happens to our body after death
On leaving the body, the [soul](/about/sould) returns to the [spiritual world](/about/spiritual-world)
where it exists as a free spirit (i.e., free from the limitations of the physical world)
and where it will stay for an indeterminate time until it enters a new incarnation.  

The soul possesses its individuality before incarnating and will preserve it after the death of the body.
This is a profound source of suffering for those that don't believe in _life after death_,
especially for victims of [suicide](/about/suicide).


### What happens to the Soul after life
On returning to the spirit world, the soul (now, a [disencarnated](/about/disencarnation) spirit)
meets those it has known on Earth. In addition, it gradually recalls the actions,
both good and harmful, of its former lives.
