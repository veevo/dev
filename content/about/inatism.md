Innatism is a philosophical and epistemological doctrine that holds that the mind is 
born with ideas/knowledge, and that therefore the mind is not a "blank slate" at birth, 
as early empiricists such as John Locke claimed. 

It asserts that not all knowledge is gained from experience and the senses.
