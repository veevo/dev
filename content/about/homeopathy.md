Homeopathy or homœopathy is a pseudoscientific system of alternative medicine. 

It was created in 1796 by Samuel Hahnemann. Its practitioners, called
homeopaths, believe that a substance that causes symptoms of a disease in
healthy people would cure similar symptoms in sick people; this doctrine is
called similia similibus curentur, or "like cures like".

It is believed that Homeopathy is a medical system based on the belief that the
body can cure itself. 

Those who practice it use tiny amounts of natural substances, like plants and
minerals.  They believe these stimulate the healing process.

It was developed in the late 1700s in Germany. It’s common in many European
countries, but it’s not quite as popular in the United States.
