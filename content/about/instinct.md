Instinct [from Latin instinctu ] - A kind of rudimentary intelligence that
directs living beings in their actions, in spite of their will and in the
interest of their conservation. 

Instinct becomes intelligence when deliberation arises. 

On instinct one acts without reasoning; by intelligence one reasons oneself
before acting.  In man instinctive ideas are often confused with intuitive
ideas. The latter are the ones he drew, both in the state of Spirit and in
previous existences and of which he keeps a vague memory.
