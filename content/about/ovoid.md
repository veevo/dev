Ovoid - the stage of degradation that certain suffering-obsessing spirits
reach. 

The spirit, linked to the obsessed, intrinsically in its eagerness to harm,
takes on an ovoid shape, resembling an egg of indefinite consistency that
"sticks" to the body of your target by distorting your thoughts, opinions and
acting incessantly to provide you with all sorts of misfortunes. 

The binding of an obsessed observer on the ovoid level, though not very
frequent, happens more than you might think. karmic bonding of two spirits at a
very advanced level. 

Under this, an individual suffering from the action of an ovoid appears with a
human "mass" glued to the body, usually on the back or abdomen. An ovoid, in
addition to the psychological obsession itself agedraining the forces of the
obsessed into death. 

In the work of disobsession it is possible to subtract an ovoid from a person,
despite the great difficulty and numerous sessions to be performed, but there
are cases of failure at the end of years of sessions. This shows the level of
connection between persecutor and persecuted.
