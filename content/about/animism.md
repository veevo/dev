All mediums and directors of mediumship sessions must be aware of, and know how to recognize, the phenomenon of animism.  Animism is a state of trance, provoked unconsciously and unintentionally, by the spirit of the medium.  This is made possible by the property of expansion of the medium’s perispirit, and occurs without any intervention from another spirit.  As the author, Martins Peralva, writes, "Many times, that which appears to be a mediumistic trance, with all the appearances of the influence of a spirit, is nothing more than the medium, naturally a maladjusted medium, reliving scenes and events extracted from his own subconscious mind, a phenomena which is provoked by the magnetic contact, meaning the approach of entities with whom the medium shares experiences of the remote past.  In the phenomena of animism, the medium expresses himself as if there were truly a discarnate spirit there to communicate."

Animism is provoked by the fixation of the mind on some circumstance, thus provoking a state in which a being, incarnate or discarnate, sees nothing, hears nothing, and feels nothing outside of that situation.  Isolating himself from the world around him, such an individual begins to concentrate his thoughts and energies around his own imbalance, crystallizing himself in time. At some point in time, the spirit is able, most likely with the intervention and help of others, to free himself from this self-inflicted captivity.  However, at a later point in time, the memory of that fixation could resurface in the form of animistic phenomena.  Peralva writes, "The crystallization of the mind on given situations, today, can provoke a future manifestation of the animistic phenomena, just as such fixation of the mind, at some time in the past, can exteriorize itself in the present."

 Animism, having the same appearance as a truly mediumistic communication, may not be evident from the start.  However, it can be recognized, over time, as the director(s) and members of the mediumistic group find that a particular medium's communications begin to repeatedly display the same characteristics and to revolve around the same type of situations, emotions and thoughts. 

How should a case of animism be handled once it has been discovered?  Peralva explains.  He writes, (quoting, in part from Andre Luiz's book, "In the Domains of Mediumship")

The medium, in those conditions, should be treated with the same attention that we administer to the suffering spirits who communicate.  For that reason the directors' oversight of mediumship work requires, without a doubt, much love, comprehension, and patience — virtues that, together, result in what the instructors classify as “Fraternal Touch”.  The intention is to avoid hurting those who find themselves in such conditions.

If the director of mediumistic sessions does not have a sincere good-will, we believe that a medium, in his group, will receive little or no benefit. The medium inclined toward animism is a defective vessel that can be fixed and restored to full service through the director's understanding, or destroyed by his lack thereof.  Readjusted, patiently, with the resources of evangelic charity, the medium can be transformed into a valuable work partner.  Misunderstood, he could become a victim of obsession.

As you can see, the potential for the phenomenon of animism presents another reason why the teachers of Spiritism advise their students that the development and exercise of mediumship should be done at the appropriate place, such as a responsible and serious Spiritist center, under the support and guidance of a knowledgeable and benevolent director.

Animismo [do latim anima= alma + -ismo] - 1. Teoria segundo a qual a alma é simultaneamente princípio de vida orgânica e psíquica. 2. Para o Espiritismo, é relativo aos fenômeno intelectuais e físicos que deixam supor uma atividade extracorpórea ou a distância do organismo humano, e mais especialmente todos os fenômenos que podem ser explicados por uma ação que o homem vivo exerce além dos limites do corpo, ou seja, o conjunto dos fenômenos psíquicos produzidos com a cooperação consciente ou inconsciente dos médiuns em ação. Se ele tem por causalidade o Espírito desencarnado, o fenômeno denomina-se espiritual ou mediúnico; mas, se o Espírito é o próprio encarnado, chama-se anímico.
