Previous lives are past material existences from previous
[incarnations](../incarnation).

While the [spirit is immortal](../immortal-spirit), each existent lived on a
[material world](../material-world) can be considered one different material
life, thus it's common to use the expression _previous life_ to denote these
previous material existences.
