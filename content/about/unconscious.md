Unconscious [from Latin in + conscious ] - 

The set of psychic processes and facts that act upon the conduct of the individual, 
but which escape the realm of consciousness, to which they cannot be brought about 
by effort of will or memory. 

However, they may arise in dreams, in failed acts, in neurotic or psychotic states, 
that is, when consciousness is not vigilant.
