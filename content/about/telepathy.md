Telepathy [Greek terle + pat- + -ia ] - 

Transfer of thoughts and emotions from person to person without the use of known senses. 

[Allan Kardec](/bio/allan-kardec) used the term human telegraphy, meaning the communication 
at a distance between two living people, which evoke each other. 

This evocation causes the emancipation of the soul, or the incarnate Spirit, which comes 
to manifest and can communicate its thought by writing or by any other means.
