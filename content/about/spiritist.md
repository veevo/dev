Spiritist [from French spirite] - Neologism created by Allan Kardec, in 
"The Spirits' Book", to mean: 

a) what is related to Spiritism; 
b) adept of Spiritism; 
c) one who can be recognized "for his moral transformation and for his efforts to tame 
his evil inclinations." 

The codifier of the Spiritist Doctrine classifies: 

I - Christian Spiritist: one who is not content to admire the spiritist spirit, practicing it and accepting all the consequences; 

II - Exalted Spiritist: one who accepts everything without reflection or examination, being more harmful than useful to the Doctrine; 

III - Experiencing Spiritist: one who is interested only in manifestations, phenomena, unaware of the moral aspect of the Doctrine; 

IV - Imperfect Spiritist: who, understanding the philosophical part, admire the morals that result, but do not practice it; 

V - Unknowing Spiritist: one who, having never heard of the Doctrine, has an innate feeling of its principles, which are reflected in his writings and speeches. See: Spiritist.
