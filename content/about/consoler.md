Variance of [Consoler](../consoler).

Just as Christ said: “I did not come to destroy the Law but to fulfill it”.

Spiritism says: We have not come to destroy the Christian Law but to carry it out. It teaches nothing contrary 
to what was taught by Christ. Rather it develops it, explains it in a manner that can be understood by all and 
completes that which had previously been known only in its allegoric form.

Spiritism realizes what Jesus said of the promised Consoler, by bringing knowledge of those things which allow 
humankind to know where we came from, where we are going and why we are on Earth; so attracting humankind towards 
the true principles of God’s law and offering consolation through faith and hope.”

It reveals new and more profound concepts with respect to God, the Universe, Human Beings, the Spirits, and the Laws that govern life itself.
