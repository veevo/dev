Acting on the nervous system, magnetic fluid produces in some people an effect
that is comparable to natural sleep but differs from it essentially in many
respects. The main difference is that in this state, thought is entirely free,
the individual has perfect knowledge of himself and the body can act as in the
normal state, which is because the physiological cause of magnetic sleep is
not. the same as natural sleep. However, natural sleep is a transitory state
that always precedes magnetic sleep, the passage from one to another is a true
awakening of the soul. This is why those who are first put on magnetic
sleepwalking almost always answer no to this question: do you sleep? And
indeed, since they see and think freely, it is not for them to sleep in the
vulgar sense of the word.
