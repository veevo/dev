Oracle [Latin the raculu ] - 

According to pagan beliefs, responses of the gods, through the mouth of
Pythias, the questions addressed to them. 

By extension, it can also designate the person who pronounced the answer, as
well as the various means employed to know the future. 

Belief in oracles had its origin in the communications of the spirits that
quackery, cupidity, and the love of dominion surrounded with prestige, and
which we now see in all their simplicity.
