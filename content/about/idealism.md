In philosophy, idealism is the group of metaphysical philosophies which assert
that reality, or reality as humans can know it, is fundamentally mental,
mentally constructed, or otherwise immaterial. 

Epistemologically, idealism manifests as a skepticism about the possibility of
knowing any mind-independent thing.

Other definitions are:
- The act or practice of envisioning things in an ideal and often impractical
  form.
- Pursuit of one's ideals, often without regard to practical ends.
- Idealized treatment of a subject in literature or art.
