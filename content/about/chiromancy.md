Palmistry, or chiromancy, is the claim of characterization and foretelling the 
future through the study of the palm, also known as chirology, or in popular 
culture as palm reading. 

The practice is found all over the world, with numerous cultural variations. 

Those who practice chiromancy are generally called palmists, hand readers, 
hand analysts, or chirologists.
