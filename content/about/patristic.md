The name of patristic is given to the stage of reasoning and the fixation of
Christian dogmas. 

This great work was carried out by the first priests of the Church in the early
centuries of the Christian era. They sought to establish and explain Christian
doctrine, showing that it was perfectly worthy of being accepted by the Roman
authorities and the people in general.
