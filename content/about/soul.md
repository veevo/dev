Alma [Latin: anima , from Greek: anemos = breath, emanation, air] - It is the immaterial, 
distinct and individual being, united with the body that serves as its temporary envelope, 
that is, the Spirit in the state of incarnation, and that only It belongs to the human 
species. 

Joined to the [material body](../material-body) by the [incarnation](../incarnation), 
the Spirit constitutes man; so that in man there are three things: the soul itself, or intelligent principle; the perispirit, or fluidic envelope of the soul; the body, or material wrap.

The soul of vegetables is said to be simply vital. The animal is called instinctive because 
it is endowed with instinctive intelligence. 

The soul of man is said spiritist or moral, because it is endowed with free will. 
One notices that the soul of animals is both vital and instinctive, while that of man is 
something else, since in the latter his species-specific property is distinguished by the 
high degree of development of which intelligence is taken by the free. will. 

Although man's physical body obeys classificatory standards that he would call him belonging to the Animal Kingdom, from the moral point of view, Man is master of his own kingdom, the Hominal. (Bezerra de Menezes, "The Madness under New Prima").

The soul is the name given to an [incarnated](/about/incarnation) spirit. 

In [Spiritism](/spiritism) we make this distinction so it's clear when studying that we're 
talking about the spirit of an incarnated person.

The body is simply the _material envelope_ that a Spirit _temporarely_ utilizes. 
By _temporarely_ we mean "during the existing life of an incarnated spirit."

On leaving the body, the soul returns to the [spirit-world](../spiritual-world), 
where it exists as a free spirit (i.e., free from the limitations of the physical world) 
and where it will stay for an indeterminate time until it enters a new incarnation.  

### Characteristics of the Soul
The soul possesses its individuality before incarnating and will preserve it after the death of the body.
This is a profound source of suffering for those that don't believe in _life after death_,
especially for victims of [suicide](/about/suicide).

### What happens to the Soul after life
On returning to the spirit world, the soul (now, a [disencarnated](/about/disencarnation) spirit)
meets those it has known on Earth. In addition, it gradually recalls the actions,
both good and harmful, of its former lives.  

## Forces of the Universe
The two main forces of the [Universe](/about/universe) are: [Spirit](/about/immortal-spirit) and [matter](/about/matter).
