According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice):

Vice is a practice, behaviour, or habit generally considered immoral, sinful,
criminal, rude, taboo, depraved, or degrading in the associated society. In more
minor usage, vice can refer to a fault, a negative character trait, a defect, an
infirmity, or a bad or unhealthy habit. Vices are usually associated with a
transgression in a person's character or temperament rather than their
morality.

The opposite of vice is [virtue](../virtue).

Vices are habits and activities that are not beneficial to an individual. It
usually produces negative consequences in the physical, emotional, mental, social,
and spiritual aspect of a person. 

## Types of Vices
Vices can be categorized in material and moral.

### Material vices
Vices can also be categorized in moral and material.

Unfortunately the vast majority of the population
today is under some type of *material vice*, including (but not limited to):
drug addiction, smoking, games, social networking, gambling, sex, pornography,
drinking amongst others.

### Moral vices
Let's not forget the second (and more subtle) category of vices: moral. In this
category we can include (but not limit ourselves to): selfishness, corruption,
lazyness, pride, anger, intolerance, impatience, amongst others.

*Every human being on Earth* posess moral vices. That is because,
being a low-morally developed world, the [spirits](/about/immortal-spirit) that
here inhabit lack moral development.

## Obsession
It is also important to point out that in all cases, people with (especially)
material vices (such as sensualists, alcoholics, drug addicts, etc) begin 
to attract obsessive spirits to themselves. This happens due to the [law of
attraction](/laws/attraction) that teaches that spirits with similar
addictions, seek to tune in with people who use alcohol and drugs, which are in
the same vibratory pattern, and, as true [vampires](/about/vampirism), start to
use them in obsessive process to suck out their energies. 

Therefore, in addition to a rigorous medical treatment, the dependent is still
[incarnated](/about/incarnation) also needs spiritual assistance to ward off the
[obsessive spirits](/about/obsessor) and prevent it from being harassed again.

## Study on vices and virtues 
Because understanding our vices and virtues is essentially important for knowing
ourselves, becoming better people and living a better and happier life, we
prepared *special sections* to discuss them in detail:
