Pass [from Latin passare ] - 

1. Transfusion of psychophysical energies altering the cell body. 

2. Transmission of fluids from one person, incarnated or not, to another, or to
   objects. 

3. The pass may be: a) magnetic, when only the fluids of the embodied agent are
   transmitted; b) mixed, when the spiritual fluids are added to the first, by
   the will of the Spiritual Benefactors, c) spiritual, when there is no
   intermediary of the passista, with the fluids of the spirits being directly
   transferred.
