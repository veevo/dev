Incorporation [from the Latin incorporatione ] - 

1. Act or effect of incorporating (itself). 

2. The term incorporation has been applied inappropriately to psychophonic
   mediumship because it cannot have two spirits occupy the same body.
   However, some spiritist theorists affirm that the incorporation occurs when
   the Spirit, even under the medium's control, has the freedom to completely
   move the medium's body, which would also be called psychopraxia . See:
   Psychophony .

Act in which the disembodied spirit connects with the the medium's spiritual
body for interaction with the other incarnates. 

The medium's spirit momentarily gives way to the animating spirit. It always
remains in the apparatus for some time, and a longer lasting incorporation is
impossible. 

The spirit that incorporates into a body can bestow or suck energy from the
body that welcomes it, depending on the degree of advancement of the spirit in
question. The spirit of the medium remains linked to his body by the "silver
cord." 

Incorporation is one of the most interesting and practiced spiritist phenomena.
Its possibilities are very vast, not only from the point of view of effective
communication with the spirit but also its interaction with the physical
environment. more properly. 

In many cases,a great exhaustion on the part of the spirit immediately after
disembodiment, possibly due to the great energetic exchange that occurs between
the spirit, the medium and the environment. (Basic reading: "The Mediums' Book"
by Allan Kardec) (see "Silver Cord")
