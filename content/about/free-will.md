1. Freedom of judgment and conduct, understood as a result of
pure of will, when faced with a choice. 

2. It is the moral freedom of man, college that he has to guide himself by his
will in carrying out their acts.

## The Law of Free Will
Human Beings are given the free will to act, but they must answer for the
consequences of their actions. There is no fate. From the moment of our creation
we are free to take whatever paths we wish to take. We can learn and evolve at
our own pace and deal with the consequences of our mistakes as we see fit.

When it is time for us to reincarnate we even choose our next existence and the
trials that we will learn from in that existence. Even the nature of our death
and length of our lives are in our hands.
