Sylphs [from Latin sylphu ] - 

According to the Celtic and Germanic mythology of the Middle Ages, the sylphs were the 
geniuses of the air, as the gnomes were those of the earth and the undines were those 
of the waters. They were represented in human form, semi-vaporous, with graceful features, 
transparent wings. 

They were given the power to become visible or invisible at will.
