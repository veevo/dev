Paradise [from the Greek paradeizos = garden, vergel] - 
Term that designates ' abode of the blessed ', in the spiritist understanding. 

The ancients placed him in the part of the Hell called the Champs Elysees. 
Modern people place it in the high regions of space. 
This word is synonymous with Heaven , taken in the same sense, with the difference 
that the word Heaven is linked with an idea of ​​infinite beatitude, 
while the word paradise is more circumscribed and recalls slightly more material joys. 

Science has already proved that heaven and hell, as well as paradise, are only 
allegories, having no real existence. 

The doctrine taught by the superior spirits is in agreement with science.
