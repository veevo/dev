Volition [from the scholastic Latin volitione ] - 

1. Literally: to want, to desire, to have the intention. 

2. Designates a conscious impulse that leads the personality to think and
   perform an action to a certain end.

The ability of a spirit to have, under certain conditions and a certain moral
advance, to be able to transpose itself by rising from the ground in a kind of
flight, hence the name volition and / or volition. if in the spirit world at
your pleasure. But those who enjoy this faculty are those spirits who are
already detached or partially disinterested in their links with matter and its
delusional pleasures. The reports linked to volition cause us extreme interest
and excitement because it is, of course, a rather pleasurable and therefore
coveted specialty of the spirit. However, it is necessary to remember that this
capacity only appears in detached spirits of the matter, of a certain degree of
moral advance.Since spirits still subjugated to matter relate in the spirit
world in the same way when incarnated, that is, if they wish to move from one
place to another, they will have to do so by their own means as if they were in
the physical world.
