Somnambulism [from Latin somnus = sleep and ambulare = march, walk] - State of
emancipation of the soul more complete than in the dream. The dream is
imperfect sleepwalking. In sleepwalking, the lucidity of the soul, that is, the
faculty of seeing, which is one of the attributes of its nature, is most
developed. She sees things more precisely and clearly, the body can act on the
impulse of the soul's will. Absolute forgetfulness at the moment of awakening
is one of the characteristic signs of true sleepwalking, since the independence
of soul and body is more complete than in the dream.
