Possessed [Latin possessu] - According to the idea linked to this word, the
possession is one in which a demon came to lodge. Taking the devil not in his
ordinary sense, but in the sense of evil spirit, impure spirit, evil spirit,
imperfect spirit, it would be a question of whether a spirit of this nature or
any other may elect domicile in the body of a man in conjunction with a man.
what is incarnated in him, or replacing him. One might ask what fate the latter
expels in the latter case. 

The Spiritist Doctrine says that the Spirit united to the body cannot be
separated from it definitively but by death; that another Spirit cannot be in
its place or unite with the body simultaneously with him; but she also says
that an imperfect Spirit can bind to the incarnate Spirit, take possession of
it, master its thought, compel it,if he has no strength to resist her, to do
such a thing, to act in such a sense; he constrains it, as it were, under his
influence. 

Thus there is no possession, in the absolute sense of the word, there is
subjugation; It is not a matter of dislodging an evil Spirit, but to use a
material comparison, to let it go, which we can always do when we seriously
desire it; but there are people who delight in a dependence that flatters their
tastes and desires.but there are people who delight in a dependence that
flatters their tastes and desires.but there are people who delight in a
dependence that flatters their tastes and desires.
