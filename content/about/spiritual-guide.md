According to the [Spirits' Book](/books/spirits-book), Spiritual Guides (or
Spiritual Mentors, Guardian Angles or Protective Spirits) are “high order”
Spirits who attach themselves to a particular individual, such as a spiritual
brother. 

As for the mission of the protective Spirit, it is the mission of a father to
his son, that is, to lead him in the right way, to help him with his counsels,
to comfort him in his afflictions, to sustain his courage in the trials of
life. . (LE, 491)

Importantly, the protective Spirit is attached to the individual from birth to
death, as often the connection continues on the spiritual plane, and even
through various reincarnatory experiences. This is because, according to Higher
Spirituality, the experiences in the material world are nothing but very short
phases of the life of the Spirit.

Given these statements, we are aware that every Protective Spirit is
necessarily a Spirit of high morality and intellectuality, given the complexity
and grandeur of his mission, which is to lead an imperfect Spirit to
perfection. 

However, he is profoundly aware of the soul of his protégé, being aware of his
conflicts, moral vices, fears, limitations, qualities, achievements, and
evolutionary potentialities, by accompanying him from past existences.

St. Louis and St. Augustine, assert that the Guardian Angels or Protective
Spirits accompany their protégés, “In jails, in hospitals, in the dens of vice,
in solitude, nothing separates you from this friend whom you cannot see, but
from whom you soul receives the sweetest impulses and listens to the wisest
advice. ”And they add,“ Ah, because ye know not this truth better! How many
times would she help you in times of crisis; How many times would she save you
from evil spirits! (...) Ah, call upon your guardian angels, establish among
you and them that tender intimacy which reigns among the best friends! Do not
think to hide anything from him, for they are the eyes of God and you cannot
deceive them! ”(LE., Chapter XIX, Book II, p. 459)
