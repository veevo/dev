Man [from Latin homine ] - 

Among the different species of corporeal beings, the human was chosen for the
incarnation of the spirits that reached a certain degree of development, which
gives it the moral and intellectual superiority over others. 

There are three things in man: a) the body or material being analogous to those
of animals and animated by the same vital principle; b) the soul or immaterial
being, Spirit incarnate in the body; c) the bond that unites the soul with the
body, the intermediate principle between matter and the Spirit. 

Man thus has two natures: through the body he participates in the nature of
animals, of which he has the instinct; by soul, partakes of the nature of
spirits.
