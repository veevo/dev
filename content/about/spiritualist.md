Spiritualist [from Latin spirituale + -ista] - What has to do with spiritualism; partisan of spiritualism. Whoever believes that everything in us is not only matter, is spiritualist, which in no way implies the belief in the manifestations of spirits. Every spiritist is necessarily spiritualist; but one can be spiritualist without being spiritist; the materialist is neither one nor the other. It is said: spiritualist philosophy. - A work written with spiritualist ideas - Spiritist manifestations are produced by the action of spirits on matter. - Spiritist morality derives from the teaching given by the spirits. - There are spiritualists who ridicule the spiritist beliefs. In these examples, the replacement of the word spiritualist by the word spiritist, would produce obvious confusion.
