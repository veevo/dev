Metempsychosis [from Greek: meta = change + en = in + psukê = soul] - 

1. Transmigration of soul from one body to another. 

2.Philosophical doctrine of Indian origin, transported to Egypt, from where Pythagoras later imported 
it to Greece. The disciples of this philosopher taught that it is possible for the same soul, 
after a more or less long period in the empire of the dead, to animate other bodies of men or 
animals until the time of its purification has passed and it can return to the source of life. . 

As it turns out, there is a major difference between metempsychosis and the doctrine of reincarnation: 
first, metempsychosis admits the transmigration of the soul to the body of animals, which would 
be a degradation; Secondly, this transmigration only operates on Earth. 

The spirits teach the opposite, that reincarnation is a constant progress, that man is a being whose 
soul has nothing in common with that of animals,that the different existences can be realized, either 
on Earth or by progressive law, in higher order worlds, until it becomes purified Spirit.
