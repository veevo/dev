## Definition
Spirit [from Latin spiritu ] - 

## The intelligent principle
The essential nature of spirit has yet to be revealed to humans. But one can
think of a spirit as “the intelligent principle of the universe” with their
individual qualities, virtues, deffects and particular intelligence.

Spirit is not matter. However, the union between spirit and matter is necessary
to provide the spirit with tools to manifest itself, learn and progress. From
the human perspective, since our senses aren’t designed to perceive spirits
apart from matter, this union is also necessary for the manifestation of
intelligent activity.  

Spirits are the intelligent beings of the universe, created by God "simple
and ignorant" but destinated to be perfect, pure and happy as the model and
guide of humanity, Jesus.

## Incarnate/Discarnate
Spirits can be either incarnate (incorporated in a material body and living
in the material world) or as discarnate (freed from a material body and
living in the spiritual realm).

In the special sense of the Spiritist Doctrine, the Spirits are the intelligent
beings of creation, who populate the Universe outside the material world and
constitute the invisible world. 

They are not beings of a special creation, but the souls of those who lived on
Earth or in the other spheres and left the body shell.

## What is a Spirit 
Human Being is a Spirit incarnated in a material body. The perispirit is the semi-material body that unites the Spirit to the physical body.

In addition to the corporeal world inhabited by incarnate Spirits, which are Human Beings, there exists the spiritual world, inhabited by discarnate Spirits.

### Creation of Spirits
Spirits are created simple and ignorant.  
The Spirits are the intelligent beings of creation.  
They constitute the world of the Spirits, which pre-exists and outlives everything.  

### Evolution of Spirits
They evolve intellectually and morally, passing from a lower order to a higher one, until they attain perfection, where they will enjoy unalterable bliss.  
Spirits are always progressing. In their multiple physical existences, they may sometimes become stationary but they never regress. The speed of their intellectual and moral progress depends on the efforts they make to attain perfection.  

### Order of Spirits
Spirits belong to different orders according to the degree of perfection they have attained:
* Pure Spirits, who have attained maximum perfection;
* Good Spirits, whose predominant desire is towards goodness; and
* Imperfect Spirits, characterized by their ignorance, their tendency towards evil, and by their lower passions.

### Incarnation
Spirits preserve their individuality before, during, and after each incarnation.  
Spirits reincarnate as many times as is necessary for their spiritual advancement.

### Progression
Spirits are always progressing. In their multiple physical existences, they may sometimes become stationary but they never regress. The speed of their intellectual and moral progress depends on the efforts they make to attain perfection.

### Interaction with Humanity
The Spirits’ relations with Human Beings are constant and have always existed. The Good Spirits attract us towards goodness, sustain us in life’s trials, and help us bear them with courage and resignation. The Imperfect Spirits induce us towards error. 

## Other characteristics of the Spirits

A spirit is not, therefore, an abstract being, a concept of thought. Rather, it is a real and well-defined entity that, in certain situations, can be perceived by sight, hearing, and touch.   

Spirits belong to different orders; likewise they are not equals in power, intelligence, knowledge, or ethical excellence.  Those in the highest order are distinguished by purity, knowledge, and love of goodness.  They are the so-called "angels" or "pure spirits."  The others are relatively more distant from this perfection.  Those in the lower orders are inclined to most of our human feelings and may still take pleasure in wrong-doing.  Among them are those who are neither very good nor very bad, but have malicious, mischievous or irksome natures.  These might be classed as giddy and foolish spirits.    

Spirits do not belong perpetually to the same order.  They are destined to attain perfection and, as they do so, to progress up through the different orders.  This advancement is achieved through incarnations, which are undertaken either as special missions or as trials leading to purification.  Physical life is an experience sprits must undergo many times before reaching this goal.  These lives can be understood as cleansing exercises from each of which spirits generally emerge in a more purified state.    

Spirits constantly exert an influence on both the physical and ethical environment of the Earth.  They constitute one of the powers of nature, since they may act equally upon matter and thought.  They are the cause of many sorts of previously unexplained or misinterpreted phenomena, which may now find a compelling rationale in the Spiritist Doctrine.  

Spirits constantly interrelate with human beings.  The good ones inspire people to take the high road, sustain them through trials, and instill in them courage and resignation.  On the other hand, the less advanced ones inculcate sordid ideas and depressive thoughts.  They take pleasure in our troubles and strive to make us like themselves.  

Spirit interactions with human beings can be either subtle or direct.  The subtle communications happen without our awareness, generally in the form of inspiration.  We need to exercise discernment, however, in distinguishing between the uplifting and the malevolent kinds.  Direct exchanges occur through writing, speech, and other physical manifestations, usually with the intervention of a medium who acts as a link between the two worlds.  

Spirits may communicate spontaneously or in response to human evocations.  Generally speaking, all free intelligences may be evoked  ̶  from the most obscure to the most illustrious, from loved ones to enemies ̶  regardless of the epoch in which they lived.  If permitted, they may share information about their new situation, their thoughts regarding us, and any insights they feel like imparting.  

Spirits move by laws of affinity.  Advanced spirits take pleasure in assemblies with a serious purpose, wherein members are animated by love and a sincere desire to learn and progress.  Their presence repels less advanced spirits.  The latter, in turn, find themselves at ease among frivolous and simple minds who come together solely out of curiosity or other harmful motives.  In such assemblies, nothing useful is produced.  To make matters worse, they often borrow venerated names to impose their ideas more effectively.  

It is easy to distinguish between advanced and less advanced spirits.   The language of higher spirits is dignified, high-minded, and free from every trace of human passion.  Their counsels breathe wisdom.  Their aim is always the advancement of humanity.  On the other hand, remarks by less advanced spirits make use of commonplace, sometimes coarse, language and often contain substantial inconsistencies.  Although they sometimes make true and worthwhile statements, their observations are usually ethically flawed and full of false arguments.  They ply upon the naiveté of their audience by feeding false hopes and swelling their listeners' egos.  Obviously, enlightening communications can only be obtained in assemblies of a serious character where participants are united in thought and desire by the pursuit of love and truth.  

The ethical teachings of the higher spirits may be summed up by the words of Christ: "Do unto others as you would that others should do unto you."  In brief, do good to all and wrong no one.  This principle of action furnishes humanity with a rule of conduct with universal application, from the most trivial to the most critical matters.  

Enlightened intelligences teach that self-centeredness, pride and sensuality keep human beings engrossed in their animal nature. Accordingly, the person who detaches him or herself from worldly things and who follows "love they neighbor" grows more spiritual.  The spirits advise that we always serve others, as our means allow us, and that the strong and powerful owe assistance and protection to the weak.  They caution that the person who misuses power to oppress his or her fellow beings violates the laws of God.  They also teach that in the spirit-world nothing can be hidden; that the unavoidable presence of those we have wronged on Earth is one of the trials we must face in the spirit world; and that the ethical state of spirits, depending on how advanced or un-advanced they are, gives rise, in that world, to enjoyments or to suffering and regrets.  

Further, they teach that there are no unpardonable faults and that there is no misdeed that cannot be redressed.  Men and women find the means of redemption and progress through reincarnation.  Their desire and efforts set the pace of their advancement toward the ultimate aim of all perfection.
