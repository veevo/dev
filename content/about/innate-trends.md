Trends, ideas or knowledge not acquired that we seem to bring at birth. 

Innate tendencies have long been discussed, the reality of which is opposed by certain philosophers who claim to be all acquired. If so, how can we explain certain natural dispositions that had been revealed many times from an early age and regardless of any education? Spiritist phenomena shed great light on this issue. Experience leaves no doubt today about these kinds of trends that find their explanation in the succession of existences. The knowledge acquired by the Spirit in previous existences is reflected in later existences through what we call innate tendencies.
