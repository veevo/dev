Purgatory [from Latin purgatorium = purgare effect = purge; root purus = pure,
which is derived from the Greek pyr, pyrus = fire, ancient emblem of
purification] - 

Place of temporary atonement, according to the Catholic Church, for souls that
have yet to be purified. The Church does not define precisely where Purgatory
is and does not explain more clearly about the nature of the punishments
suffered there. 

The teaching of spirits is much more explicit in this regard. They reject, it
is true, the dogma of the eternity of penalties (see Hell).but admit a more or
less temporary temporary atonement, which is nothing but name but purgatory. 

This atonement is realized by the moral sufferings of the soul in the wandering
state.
