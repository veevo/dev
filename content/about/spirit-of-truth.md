The Spirit of Truth is a spirit quoted in the works of Allan Kardec. The quotation occurs, first, in The Spirits' Book, in the last paragraph of the prolegomena, where the active participants of the work (already disembodied personalities) are presented.

> “... Remember that the Good Spirits only give assistance to those who serve God with humility and disinterest and who repudiate anyone who seeks in the path of heaven a step to conquer the things of the earth; that move away from the proud and the ambitious. Pride and ambition will always be a barrier erected between man and God. They are a veil cast over the heavenly light, and God cannot use the blind to make the light discernible. "

The Spirit of Truth is believed to be the mentor of a phalanx of spirits who have grounded the concepts of spiritist codification. It is further believed that he would be Jesus Christ himself. He would have used the pseudonym “The Spirit of Truth” to autograph the psychographed messages in the basic works of Spiritism.
