##  Worlds of Regeneration
These are worlds where spirits who are still in assignments of purification can replenish their energies. Also called realms of renewal, these are transitional worlds that are intermediate places between worlds of expiation and bliss, where wounded souls find a place of calm and experience the dawning of happiness. They are free from unbridled passions, excessive pride, envy, and hate, displaying instead the seal of love. Fairness presides over social relations, and everyone recognizes the supreme being.  They must still undergo trials, although these don't bring the typical anguish found on inferior worlds, and they are more analogous to the recuperation period that follows a serious illness. Less absorbed by material concerns, they have a greater comprehension of future joy that is attained by spirits who show themselves worthy.
