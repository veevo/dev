## Primitive Worlds
It is in these worlds where the earliest incarnations of the human spirit take place. The inhabitants, at a rudimentary stage, have human form but no physical beauty. They act on instincts, which are not tempered by notions of social grace, goodwill, or even fairness, but rather brute force. They live their lives gathering food.  Even in these worlds, some beings are more advanced than others. The more advanced carry with them a vague intuition of a supreme being, and they help prepare the rest for the ascent to a more complete life. The spirits assure us that these people aren't degraded beings but children who are growing.
