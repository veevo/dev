##  Worlds of Trials and Purifications
The innate qualities of the inhabitants reflect previous lives and some degree of progress achieved, yet the number of vices also shows a great deal of moral imperfection, and wrong-doing still predominates. In these worlds, hard work and trying experiences that serve as instruments of education and as means of reparation, allow these beings to advance their progress of purification. The range of evolutionary stages of these individuals is wide. Likewise, the variety of such planets is infinite. However, they all have one thing in common, which is that they serve as places of exile for spirits struggling to adjust themselves to the divine law.
