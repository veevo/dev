## Introduction
There are around us [spirits](/about/spirit) of varying levels of evolution and of [moral](/about/moral)
and intellectual development, who regularly [influence](/about/spiritual-influences) us through their 
suggestions and intuitions that can be positive or negative, depending on the nature of the spirit.

But how it happens and why are they allowed to do it?

## How it happens
All of this is carefully explained on [The Spirits' Book](/books/spirits-book). Essentially,
that happens because the [material world](/about/material-world) in which we live operates 
in a continuous interaction with the [spiritual world](/about/spiritual-world) that coexists alongside side it.
The beings of both worlds are able to [influence](/about/spiritual-influences) and affect one another.

## How it happens
Spirits are able to influence one another by way of thought, first, in the role of thought as the mechanism 
behind spirit communication, and second, because the innermost (even subconscious) thoughts of any spirit 
determine the nature and quality of its own vibrations, or energies, which ultimately affect those around 
the spirit and, likewise, attract others of similar character, ideas, emotions, etc.

## Type of Influences
This influence can be positive or negative, depending on the nature of the spirit who is exercising the influence,
and when a negative influence becomes persistent and directed, it takes on the form of what is referred 
to by Spiritists, as obsession.
