## Mode of Action
As you you probably know, [we are all mediums](/spiritism/mediumship/who-is-medium/).
whether [ostensive](/about/ostensive) or not. In other words, all of us are open to the 
influence of the inhabitants of the [spiritual plane](/about/spiritual-plane), though we vary in our degree of sensitivity.

## The nature of the influence
the nature of such influence relates directly to our own vibrational qualities. That is equivalent to say that
the obsession depends strongly on the moral nature of our thoughts, intentions, and actions. 

To understand this connection, it's important to understand the [Law of affinity](/divine-laws/affinity) which 
teaches us that we attract those who think like, and about the same things, we do, and whose desires and 
behaviors are similar to our own.

For more information on the topic, please visit the [mediumship section](/spiritism/mediumship) section.

## Vibrational affinity
The key point here is that, regardless of the cause for the obsessive action of the spirit upon his victim,
it is the vibrational affinity between the two that allows for the spirit to exercise any degree of thought 
control and/or vibrational alteration upon the individual.

## Characteristics of Obsessions
The key characteristic of an obsession, as opposed to a passing, negative spiritual influence, is the 
regularity and consistency of the spirit's maleficent influence over the individual.

## About obsessing spirits
Obsessing spirits who act intentionally are extremely persistent and believe, even when encountering an initial 
or eventual resistance in their victim, that through perseverance, they will eventually achieve and sustain 
the domination that they desire. 

Even when unconscious of their negative influence, the affinity and tuning 
that is established between the obsessed and the obsessor, keep them both bound to one another and subject 
to the consequences of such mutual influence.
