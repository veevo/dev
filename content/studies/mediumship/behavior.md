## Introduction
To correctly exercise the [Mediumship](/spiritism/mediumship), serious [Mediums](../mediums) are essentially required three things:
develop [essential virtues](../virtues), overcome their weaknesses and increase their tendencies and inclinations
toward a more moral character.

But this change is not expected overnight. As with all of us it will happen over time and potentially span troughout
multiple [incarnations](/about/incarnations). What is important is the continuous effort toward improvement.

In addition to working on virtues and moral behaviour, it is expected from them a better control over thoughts, attitudes,
and reactions toward different situations. Especially the most impactful ones.

## Main Expectations
Let's now examine some characteristics a medium should have to be successful on their practice and secure their own [spiritual protection](/about/spiritual-protection).


### Regular Study of Spiritism
In order for the medium, as well as the spirits that communicate or heal through him and those who are being helped through such interactions, to benefit most from the medium's work, that medium needs to understand the mechanisms of their faculty. When he is aware of what is happening while he is under the influence of a spirit, the medium works with tranquility and confidence.  He also understands the roles of the many individual and environmental factors, both within their control and out of their control, that either facilitate or block constructive and valuable communications. In addition, this study teaches the medium not only about their own type of mediumship, but also about that of other mediums that he works with, and a mutual understanding among members of a work group always contributes to a more harmonious execution of the task. 

In addition to knowing how their mediumship functions, mediums must learn how to evaluate the outcome of their work; Spiritist resources give them the tools of analysis to understand what kind of spirits are using them as intermediaries and teaches them how to be on guard against deceptive and mystifying spirits. Also, the exercise of mediumship, while not inherently dangerous, does present potential dangers for the medium who is not on guard against the negative consequences of pride, discouragement, unhealthy thoughts and behaviors, and ultimately, the impact of the inferior spiritual influence that the former will attract. The value of Spiritism is indispensable in its lessons on how to avoid these potential dangers and deserve the cooperation and commitment of elevated spirits who seek sincere partners for carrying out God's work.

Equally important as the study of mediumistic mechanisms, if not more so, is the medium's regular study of [The Spirits' Book](/books/spirits-book),
[The Gospel According to Spiritism](/books/gospel-according-spiritism) and other philosophically enlightening and morally edifying works of [Spiritism](/spiritism).

The philosophical and moral teachings help to keep the medium grounded by teaching him about the purpose and objectives of their existence and by
explaining the conditions in which he and others find themselves living, both in the material and spiritual realms.
They also reveal to him how to overcome their difficulties and minimize their own suffering by using the tools that he has within himself.

The books help the medium to understand the moral qualities that he must develop and inspire him to work hard at doing so.
By reading from such literary sources and attending lectures at the Spiritist center, the medium, like all of us, tunes in, mentally,
with the good spirits that accompany him. He opens their mind to capture, through intuition, the advice and comfort that the spirits have to offer.

Additionally, their positive mental state, during those moments, helps him to attract healthy and uplifting energies that transform 
and rebalance their personal energy field, affording a sense of calmness. If done regularly, this will have a positive effect on their physical body, as well.   


### Frequent Prayer
For all spirits, incarnate and discarnate, prayer is an invaluable resource in obtaining both spiritual and physical balance, 
as well as in attracting positive forces to our own aid and to that of others.  For prayer to be truly beneficial, it must be sincere,
with thoughts that come from the heart, not a memorized string of words that are recited in such a way that they are devoid of any emotion.

The prayer that is most effective is also one that appeals for well-being, protection, and guidance, and not for material gifts or harmful forces. 
It is through sincere and meaningful prayer that we are able to create a link between ourselves and our spiritual benefactors;
through this link, we tune in to them, via the vital force of thought, by which they hear our appeals and offer guidance and help.

In addition, a mind engaged in prayer emits positive vibrations that are amplified by the contributions of our spiritual friends.
These vibrations envelop our spiritual and physical bodies in waves of positive energy. When the prayer is directed toward another,
we appeal to good spirits who hear our request and go to the aid of that person, who also benefits from the positive energies that we emit and project in their direction.  


### Active Participation in the Spiritist Center
The medium who works in the Spiritist center is considered a worker of that center, and it is important for him to be an active member.  This medium should participate in other activities and tasks of the center, and should not go to the center only on the days of their mediumship work. This is important because the medium needs to be in contact with the good spirits that assist that center.  He also needs to establish ties of fraternity with the other mediums, outside of the mediumship sessions, as well as with other members of the center. In addition, the Spiritist center, while at the same time a hospital, a school, and a home, operates through the volunteer work and contributions of its members.  Therefore, the active participation of all members who offer their collaboration helps the center to be a source of spiritual aid to those in need and a place of learning and friendship for all.  


### Careful Selection of Places Visited
Mediums must be careful not to make a habit of visiting places that have vicious environments,
referring here to environments charged with negative energies created by the unhealthy and morally
inferior thoughts and behaviors of those present, both incarnate and discarnate,
and the activities carried out at such places.  All mediums, no matter how moral they are, are still fallible,
like all of us, except they are even more sensitive to psychic influence.

This influence has the potential to tempt their moral weaknesses and/or affect their personal energy field, which, in turn, influences their emotional and spiritual well-being, as well as their ability to be of beneficial service to others through mediumistic practice.  At the same time, such places are not frequented by spirits of a higher order, unless they are accompanying an individual who goes there in service to help others, which should be the only condition that takes a medium to places normally visited by spirits who are only of the lower order. 


### Proper Care of the Physical Body
We've discussed, in many instances, the importance of the medium's sense of responsibility, with respect
to their moral and mental state, i.e., the conditions and qualities of their thoughts and behaviors.
However, the medium must also take good care of their physical body and avoid bad habits and vicious
behaviors that have a negative impact on their health, such as smoking, drinking, drug use, sexual promiscuity,
excessive and unhealthy eating, etc.

All of these activities, while obviously detrimental to their own physical body, also pollute the medium's
spiritual energies and impede their ability to offer healthy, positive vital fluids to those whom he are in need of their aid. 

One obvious example of this is the healing medium, who loses their ability to donate good energies of their own and may even present a potential harm to the patient, if their negative energies are not blocked by the patient's lack of affinity or nullified by the work of good spirits. Another example stems from the positive impact received by suffering spirits who are able to absorb the calming and healthy energies of a medium through whom they communicate in a mediumship session; this donation of energy by the medium is, again, hampered by the consequences of the medium's neglectful behavior.  These behaviors do not only harm their body and impede their work. They also attract inferior spirits who share in the same material passions and vices, and who literally feed off of the energies and fluidic formations created by the incarnate being's inferior thoughts and actions, while robbing him of vital fluids.  

### Charity and Compassion
Whenever possible, one should seek to recognize the opportunities that he is given to be compassionate toward others.
When done discreetly, and from the heart , with no ulterior motives, acts of charity not only benefit those who are receiving,
but also have multiple rewards for those who practice acts of kindness.
After all, as stated in the famous prayer from Saint Francis, "it is in giving that we receive".

Likewise, this sentiment is echoed by Spiritism which teaches that "without charity, there is no salvation."
For the medium, in particular, the regular practice of charity also represents one way in which he can prove to
the superior spirits that he is dedicated to good-will and deserving of their support and collaboration.  

## Conclusion
Remember that the above list is the minimum necessary by a medium from the superior spirits so that he progresses in their
mediumship and on their virtues in general. Much more important are the efforts he makes to progress that what he does.
