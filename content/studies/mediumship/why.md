As [previously said](../about), mediumship is a native aspect of every person and has a different purpose on each of us. See below what they are.

### Learning
Mediumship is an important tool for learning, amplifying the mediums virtues and vices.
Giving the medium an opportunity to learn from this new awareness of [God](/about/god), the 
Spirit and the [spiritual world](/about/spiritual-world).
And to learn from all that comes with developing, and practicing the gift.

### Expiation
Mediumship gives the medium a unique opportunity to pay off past debts.
If the medium chooses to use their ability to do good then the [expiation](/about/expiation) is two fold.
First because of the self sacrifice and overcoming of temptation needed to make such a choice, and 
second from the constant works of charity performed when the gift is used to help others.

### Revelation
Mediumship is a precious instrument for revealing to people the truths about God,
the [immortality of the soul](/about/immortal-spirit), [Godâ€™s laws](/divine-laws),
the existence of the [spiritual world](/about/spiritual-world) and the [after life](/about/erraticity).

### Information

It also provides information directly from Spirits to individuals who need this guidance.

### Healing
