In this volume you will find a description of the lower regions of the spirit
realm and the suffering to which the guilty conscience is subject after the
death of the physical body.

Andre Luiz presents studies of real-life cases and offers guidance regarding
paying oneâ€™s spiritual debts, the law of cause and effect, preparations for
reincarnation, collective expiations, and the value of prayer.

The spirit author shows that the possibilities of our current existence are
connected to our actions in past existences, just as our actions of today will
condition our possibilities in the future.
