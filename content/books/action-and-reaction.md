## Description
In this volume you will find a description of the lower regions of the spirit realm and the suffering to which the guilty conscience is subject after the death of the physical body.

Andre Luiz presents studies of real-life cases and offers guidance regarding paying one’s spiritual debts, the law of cause and effect, preparations for reincarnation, collective expiations, and the value of prayer.

The spirit author shows that the possibilities of our current existence are connected to our actions in past existences, just as our actions of today will condition our possibilities in the future.
