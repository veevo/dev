Rabindranath Tagore’s extraordinary sensibility, through Divaldo Franco’s
psychography, rewards us with beautiful poems, a real cascade of light,
overflowing with tenderness and love! The noble Spirit-poet says
> "My songs are living poems of love releasing themselves from the tight prison
> of emotion from whence they are born and conquering the expanse like birds of
> happiness."

These songs move our souls and fill our hearts with joy, stimulating our
sensibilities for the constant practice of good.
