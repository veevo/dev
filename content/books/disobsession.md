In this book, the spiritual mentor, André Luiz, presents the basic guidelines
for the Spiritist mediumship session that is held for the loving and dedicated
rescue work of disobsession.  He outlines the flow of events, before, during,
and after the session, discusses the various members of the work team and their
roles, and offers sound advice regarding the sense of care and responsibility
with which each participant, as well as the group as a whole, should carry out
their tasks.

This is a must read for anyone who wishes to participate in this kind of
mediumistic work, and a recommended reading for anyone who wishes to learn more
about mediumship and the work of Spiritist Centers.

The faculty of mediumship, with its various manifestations, has been the
dominant factor in proving the reality of the afterlife and the transcendental
nature of the universe. Through this faculty, a multitude of phenomena has been
witnessed, demonstrating to the astonishment of many that intelligence is not
merely a product of brain cells.

Among the several types of mediumship known today, psychography is the most
often used within Spiritism, especially for the writing of books and messages.

André Luiz’ purpose in writing this book was to recruit new groups of workers of
goodness, whose intent is to aid in the readjustment of those no longer in the
physical plane and who have become distanced from reality. There is nothing more
appropriate and just for if ignorance needs the dedication of teachers, and
psychopathology awaits the abnegation of doctors who use of techniques of
balanced dialogue in the practice of psychoanalysis, so it is that mental
alienation of the discarnate beings demands the fraternal assistance of friendly
hearts with enough understanding and an abundance of love to aid them at
spiritist centers.

Through the work of several collaborators, this volume is an important synthesis
in the effort to aid those suffering from obsessive processes. It is
characterized by its absolute simplicity in the explanation of the circumstances
that are indispensable for the constitution and maintenance of spiritist groups,
which are devoted to the liberation and healing task of disobsession.
