Hail, Christ! Those who will live forever glorify and salute you!

The partnership between the medium Franciso CÃ¢ndido Xavier and the spirit
Emmanuel reveal the story of Quintus Varrus and Tacianus, two souls connected by
many reincarnations, and who meet each other once again in the third century of
Christianity in a region controlled by the Roman Empire. As an example of
simplicity, trust, and love, the pioneers of the Good News devoted themselves to
serving Christ, having as their sustenance only their powerful and unshakable
faith.

This is a moving story that shows how much true love can accomplish in its
manifestations of solidarity on behalf of human individuals.
