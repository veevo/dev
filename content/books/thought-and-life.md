What part do thoughts play in our lives?

The spiritual writer Emmanuel explains how thoughts act powerfully in shaping
our lives: "Today, we are heirs to the positive reflexes from our past
experiences, having the mains to change their direction towards true happiness."

Emmanuel goes on to explain with simplicity, through clear and intelligent ideas
together with comparisons based on everyday life, the effects that thought
creates in the intimacy of each one, including the ambient in which a person may
live.

He further explains the connection between emotion and thought, showing that
human beings have the capacity to supervise and control them in benefit of
progress.
