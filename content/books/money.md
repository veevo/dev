This book explains that money is actually a neutral tool in all human endeavors
and that it is our stewardship that actually grants it a constructive outcome.
It is a collection of thoughts on the importance of money in our lives.

As such, Emmanuel brilliantly shows us that it is our free will that ultimately
determines the consequences of what money can do for ourselves and for society
in general. Whether used to create jobs and employment, which ultimately gives
human beings the ability to provide for themselves, or to improve social and
intellectual development, money retains a remarkable similarity to blood: it is
only useful when in circulation, and it is vital for progress and the perpetuity
of our society.

To understand its importance is first and foremost to learn how it can be
employed to generate progress for all, thereby being able to transform the
earthly coins into heavenly ones.
