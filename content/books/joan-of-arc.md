Written by Leon Denis, this book recounts the life of Joan of Arc in the defeated and
annihilated 15th-century France, living as a humble peasant, without any
type of instruction, bearer of extraordinary psychic gifts, which
made it possible for the visions of the Beyond and the hearing of voices, which guided it and
sustained in the great mission he has performed, freeing his homeland from the dominion
english, in addition to pacifying and uniting her.
Spiritism explains â€”, how his visions, premonitions, voice hearing, are
analyzed as psychic phenomena that ignorance and lies have tried to
it is a book that exalts the power of faith and restores the primacy of
Truth.
