Profound and simple questions were important components of the formidable
occasions of fortunate learning during the entire period of Jesus Christ’s
Gospel.

Therefore, when we see our brothers and sisters of earthly struggles meet to
study in the Spiritist Movement, when they dedicate some of the study time to
clear doubts in an honest and healthy way, we rejoice with the possibility that
these questions and their respective answers may be documented for the
elucidation of several points of the revered Spiritist Doctrine.
