In her unique style, the noble spirit Joanna de Ângelis presents us yet another
work, Existential Conflicts, summarizing “…several disturbing behaviors which
present themselves as tests of resistance for the human individual,” focused
under the lights of psychology, psychoanalysis, and psychiatry, but under the
prism of Spiritism.

This great work, a psychography from Divaldo Franco, constitutes an excellent
opportunity for us to ponder about the problem of existence, analyzing it
judiciously. The most serious and pressing subjects parade here, clarified by
the great knowledge and expertise of our venerable mentor. Fear, anger,
laziness, jealousy, violence, love, death, psychological escapes, and so many
other conflicts, are part of the universe of this jewel offered to us by the
High Spirituality. And thus… for our understanding and evolution.
