Spiritual body, problems in the great transition, abortion, suicide, euthanasia,
cremation, fatal accidents, cemeteries, funerals, premonition, death of
childrenâ€¦ These and many other topics are discussed in this book. The author
describes the circumstances and problems associated with the return to the
Spiritual World. The reader will find in these pages an invaluable contribution
to overcome age-old fears and anguish that disturb people when dealing with
death.

The book offers the reader a good-humored insight on death. Richard Simonetti
shows that death is far from being that horrible skeleton with its sinister
scythe, tearing our hopes apart; instead, death is rather a door that leads us
into the spiritual world, where we have come from, where our true nation lies.
In bried chapters, illustrated with cartoons, "Who Is Afraid of Death?" deals
with the most important topics concerning the great transition, providing
confidence for those who depart and hope and solace for those who stay behind.
