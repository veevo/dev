The name of Francisco Cândido (“Chico”) Xavier (1910-2002) is already a legend
in his native Brazil, yet he remains almost unknown in the English-speaking
world. In this book, Guy Lyon Playfair tell the extraordinary story of how a
poorly educated man from a very modest background rose to become a national hero
while refusing any payment other than the wages he earned as a government
employee. 

The author also discusses Chico’s phenomenal literary output of more than 450
books and the countless message he received that provide some of the most
compelling evidence yet recorded for survival after death.
