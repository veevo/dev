This book presents a description of the spirit after the death of the physical
body and demonstrates that the mental state directly impacts our existence in
the spiritual world.

In twenty six chapters, the book brings the story of real characters, who
receive the help of spiritual friends upon discarnation. Those friends encourage
them to renew themselves spiritually through study and work in order for them to
prepare themselves to review and untangle the meaning of the lives they have
just finished, therefore enabling them to pursue a more constructive course of
behavior for their future.

It teaches us to examine our lives continually, knowing that, according to the
laws of God, life does in fact go on, full of hope, effort, progress, and
accomplishments after death.
