>"This book was written in a simple and objective way, and it is dedicated to
>those who are beginning their mediumistic development, with the blessings of
>the Spiritist Doctrine.  

With regard to our previous books, and taking into account the texts of “The
Mediums’ Book”, we have organized the chapters of this book, aiming to exchange
experiences with our fellows of like mind, with the certainty that we, as either
incarnate or discarnate spirits, are all mediums in the presence of life.  We
are all on the pathway of the most considerable spiritual achievements, with the
support of the gospel of Jesus, the magnificent medium of God."
