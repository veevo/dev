This book is for the person who seeks the best way to transform his heart, step
by step, from darkness into light.  It provides a sound understanding of the
consequences and effects of one's attitudes and actions, as well as insight into
the behavior of others through beautifully simple and brief statements.

The most remarkable feature about these strikingly relevant, down-to-earth
messages is that they were all received through automatic writing by the
Brazilian medium Francisco CÃ¢ndido Xavier, from the Spirit Andre Luiz, with the
intention of providing man with clear spiritual discernment.

Humanity desires knowledge and better answers to its quest for the cause and
purposes of life.  While man, in his restless search, is conquering the secrets
of the atom, outer space, and genetic keys, he has yet to learn to conquer
himself.

Christian Agenda blends Christian principles and psychology with the law of
cause and effect, or karma, to produce unusually practical and helpful guides
that aid us in the everyday aspects of life.

Its principles are universal, for the concepts of love, compassion and
botherhood do not know geographical, religious or temporal boundaries.

Dear reader, the words of this book are not meant to be merely read, but also
absorbed and meditated upon. Let these words become a living part of you and let
your own light shine.
