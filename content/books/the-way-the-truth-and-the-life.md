This book is part of an outstanding collection that includes Our Daily Bread,
Living Fountain, and Vineyard of Light. The collection was dictated by the
spirit Emmanuel with the intent of guiding Spiritists towards the practice of
Christian principles and of leading them to find inner transformation in the
teachings of Jesus, a goal that cannot be postponed.

Throughout the 180 chapters, the spiritual author comments on several verses
from the New Testament with amazing brilliance, with his depth of concept and
lightness of form springing from every page. Emmanuel shows that Spiritism is
based on the lessons of the New Testament and it is an opportunity for work and
growth to all who long to renew their minds. "The Way, the Truth and the Life"
is nourishment for the spirit, strengthening it towards the daily struggles.
