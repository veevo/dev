In the present book, Prof. Herculano Pires writes about the impossibility to
conceive nothingness, and the logic of Godâ€™s existence. In the words of Prof.
Pires, when we apply the good sense in accordance with our finite and ephemeral
modesty as creatures, before the Infinite and Eternity, we can reduce the
unlimited to the limits of the intelligible reality. 

Then the deductive reasoning, of scientific order, which comes from the evident
existence towards the accessible heights, little by little, points out a reality
that we can comprehend. God as Existent, who exists in our human reality, can be
touched with our fingers, and also realized, recognized by our ordinary senses.
We do not need extra-sensorial perceptions to perceive His existence. 

But God as Existent is the Father who Jesus introduces in rational terms, in
order to guide and aid us, constantly inviting humanity to His kingdom of
harmony and beauty.
