In 1965, the Brazilian medium [Francisco C. Xavier](/bio/chico-xavier) and 
[Waldo Vieira](/bio/waldo-vieira) travelled to
several countries, including the United States of America, England and France,
in a mission to exchange the Spiritist knowledge and visit friends. The first
part of the book contains mediumistic messages received in the Portuguese
language. Among them, there are interesting interviews with Brother X and
William James, and many other respectable people from other nations. The second
part is composed of messages directly received in the English language. 

This is a book that brings us eloquent teachings on Spiritism and Christ consciousness
once it approaches the following topics: reincarnation, mediumship, obsession,
and culture. It opens new perspectives for a greater understanding of our
brothers and sisters of all lands.
