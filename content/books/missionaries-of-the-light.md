In this volume, André Luiz unveils the secrets of reincarnation and the task of
missionary spirits in charge of the rebirth process. The spiritual author
affirms that physical death is not the end. He also stresses the importance of
self-effort in the struggle for self-improvement.

In twenty chapters, André Luiz talks about his continued learning experience in
the spiritual world, the perispirit as a living body that molds the cells that
compose the physical body, the reincarnation process, which is guided by
high-order spirits, and the different aspects of mediumistic manifestations.

Missionaries of the Light teaches that Divine Providence always grants people
new arenas of work through the incessant renewal of life by means of
reincarnation.
