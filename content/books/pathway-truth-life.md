The books, The Pathway, the Truth, & Life;  Harvest of Light;  Living Fountain;
Our Daily Bread; and Vineyard of Light  are integrated together in this
collection.  All of them are dictated by the spirit, Emmanuel, through the
mediumship of Francisco Cândido Xavier.

In them, the author comments on the Gospel's teachings in an original and
attractive way, teaching us not only to understand the Christian doctrine, but
also to practice it at all times in life.  They are truly an invitation to noble
and dignifying work and are inspired by the teachings of the Gospel.

enchants, edifies, and comforts through his pure and enchanting, gentle and
persuasive language, full of spirituality and beauty.
