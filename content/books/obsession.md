This is, in his own words, how a discarnate spirit took possession of a high
society girl exactly on her fifteenth birthday party.

The party breaks up, naturally, and the girl is committed to a mental hospital.
Had she become insane of mad, according to the usual standards of behavior? Or
was she possessed by an evil spirit? Should she be submitted to the orthodox
medical routine for such cases, or else should she be exorcized?

This book tells her story. Why she had become involved in the process, exposing
herself to her plight and what a dedicated group of both incarnate and
discarnate people did to release not only her, but also those who became
entangled with her in an ugly story way back in a previous incarnation.
