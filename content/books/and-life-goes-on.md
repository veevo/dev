This inspirational novel by Andr√© Luiz, physician and poet, who writes through
the pen of Francisco C. Xavier, gently awakens us to the rich meaning of life,
friendship, and love.  In it, we find that life is a journey on which we add to
and recreate our innermost selves - in effect designing our own path toward the
goal of love each of us seeks.

This is a true story that illuminates life. In Evelyn's courage you will
discover the force of faith, and traces of the invisible design that guides
every person's return to love."
