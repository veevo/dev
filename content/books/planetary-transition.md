All rooms in the great mansion of Our Father are inhabited and they are
progressing towards the plenitude that awaits all of us, His children. But since
the Creator is constantly at work, the many orbs in the universe are not all at
the same level of moral and intellectual development. And so it is with planet
Earth, which is now moving through a transitional phase by means of which it
will cease to be a world of trials and expiation to become one of regeneration,
where good will prevail over evil. It is important for us human beings to
understand that this transition is not a physical one, but a consequence of our
own moral and intellectual progress. Neither is the transition to be effected
overnight or within a few days; rather, it has already begun and it is occurring
all around us in a gradual and ever-improving manner. This change is the very
collective desire for improvement in every sector of human society and our
lives. As we, the spirits who inhabit this planet, improve ourselves, we
contribute to pull this event ever so forward, making it unstoppable.

There are some spirits, however, who do not understand this progressive movement
and act against it out of ignorance. As the world and life progress, these
spirits, be they incarnate or discarnate beings, become more recalcitrant and
defiant to everything that is happening around them, and in this behaviour they
set themselves apart so much from the mainstream progress that they perceive the
new world being built today as a threatening environment for them.

Our Father, however, is all mercy and understanding. It is a divine decree that
all His children shall rise to plenitude. Hence, these recalcitrant spirits will
continue their journey towards their improvement in other worlds, where they
will find the conditions to integrate themselves in the societies therein. As
our world gradually becomes one of regeneration, more and more of these ignorant
brothers and sisters will leave us to inhabit other orbs in the great mansion of
Our Father. They are leaving us through the death of their physical bodies and
their future reincarnations on other orbs.

This book discusses the transition period and the repercussions of our actions
and thoughts for this process. It also shows the importance of mutual
understanding and integration of different sectors of the human population,
especially when facing tragedies such as the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004, when
so many had their journey in the physical realm cut short. Why so many deaths in
a single event? Why did it happen? These and many other questions populate our
minds and leave us in shock and perturbation. This extraordinary book comes to
our rescue at times like this, showing to all of us the important of our working
together as humankind, no longer as a nationality or a single religious belief.
The book reiterates our desire to be as one family, to see the other as a fellow
being, and to place rational faith in the divine works, whose intention is
always our progress towards the Creator of all things.

Let your heart be filled with the touching scenes narrated in this book, which
were extracted from real rescue situations. And perchance our sensitivities will
improve beyond the need of having tragedies or the temporary separation of
recalcitrant spirits in order to move us to work as brothers and sisters in a
world that was created for one large family.
