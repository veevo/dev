The spirit Rabindranath Tagore returns after his discarnation with the same
lyricism and poetry, as evidenced in the psychographed work Aesthesis:
>"Immortal, before time and beyond eras, I bow down at the window of eternity
>so that the magic of Your work unites me ever more with You, intoxicating me
>with happinessâ€¦"

>"Wordly richness weighs down on he who possesses it, forcing him lower. The
>treasure of love lifts him up to fly, free and happy, up the gully of
>infinity."
