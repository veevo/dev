Contemporary men and women, seduced by immeasurable ambition for power which
grants them luxury, leisure, and pleasure, remain dormant to their serious
spiritual responsibilities

Considering such responsibilities to be of secondary importance, and in the vain
supposition that they can resolve their inner problems at any time, they
transfer their attention and emotions to the outside world, causing great damage
to their inner harmony… 

The unforgettable love lesson, widely repeated but rarely experienced, would be
enough to alter the moral values of human beings, providing them with happiness… 

We have gathered in this small publication 30 challenging questions that arise
frequently to trouble the human being.

Without any pretense of answering these questions, we introduce uplifting
readings and create space for a positive spiritual vision of behavior….
