is it true that we are all preexisting beings?  it means we've lived
before and even we may have met our parents, brothers and friends of other
stocks?  i mean then that death is not this definitive thing that the
people thought to be?  the book our children are spirits is a reflection on the
human being on earth.  

Children are "adult" people, lived, experienced and gifted, sometimes
of greater intellectual capacity and greater cultural baggage than many of us.
The difficulty they experience, in the first years of life in the flesh, is only the
to satisfactorily move your machine to live on Earth, which is only
'ready' to work there for adolescence and, in its best condition, there
maturity.
