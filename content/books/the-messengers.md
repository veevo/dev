This book unveils that spiritual life after death is always evolving. In 51
chapters, it describes the experiences of a number of spirits who reincarnated
with pre-planned endeavors needed for their personal spiritual growth. Moreover,
it also deals with subjects such as the Gospel worship at home, the benefits of
practicing the good, carelessness regarding oneâ€™s spiritual obligations, and
fear of death. 

The spiritual author focuses on the opportunities of service for mediums,
warning them about the need to practice at a personal level what they learn in
order to avoid returning to the spiritual world without having fulfilled the
duties assumed before reincarnating.
