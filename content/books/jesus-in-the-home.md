This book contains lessons taught by Jesus during meetings at Simon Peter’s
house, where the first Christian home worship was held. It addresses themes such
as love for one’s neighbor, the value of service, compassion, education, etc. It
demonstrates the ongoing relevance of the evangelical message.

Easy to understand by all age groups, it emphasizes the need for one’s inner
reform by renewing one’s thoughts, actions, postures and attitudes, thereby
seeking to adjust them to authentic Christian morality. The weekly gathering
around the Gospel is one of the most useful practices Christians can take part
in.

It is recommended that "Jesus in the Home" be used in conjunction with "The
Gospel According to Spiritism," "The Spirits’ Book," or any other book chosen by
the group.
