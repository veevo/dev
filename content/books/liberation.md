In this compelling narrative, André Luiz emphasizes the work of high order
spirits in the effort to convert the spirit Gregorio to the Good, an effort that
culminates with the unforgettable reencounter with his mother – herself a highly
evolved spirit – wherein he surrenders to the irresistible call of Love. The
book also contains information on how unhappy spirits act as they try to involve
incarnates in their wiles.

The spirit author tells of the intercession of high order spirits on behalf of
human beings, demonstrating the divine compassion that grants to all the blessed
opportunity to free themselves by means of study, labor and persevering service
in the practice of the Good.
