Psychographed by Francisco Cândido Xavier and Waldo Vieira, Evolution in two
worlds is divided into two parts. The first relates the words of Christ to
concepts such as the existence of the perispirit and spiritual body, cosmic fluid,
heredity, evolution and sex, spiritual feeding and mechanisms
of the mind, among others. The second part brings together questions and answers about
issues linked to marriage, divorce, pregnancy and abortion.

Combining scientific and evangelical concepts, Spirit André Luiz promotes a
study of the evolutionary process of being and soul in the two planes of our
existence —the material world and the spirit world—, establishing a challenge
intellectual to all who practice and wish to know the Doctrine
Spiritist.
