In this book, Andr√© Luiz analyzes the various aspects of mediumship, emphasizing
the efforts of mediums who are faithful to the spiritual mandate received prior
to their reincarnation. He also warns of the risks involved in poor exchanges
between the two worlds. It talks about trance, somnambulism, possession,
clairvoyance, out-of-body experiences, fascination, psychometry, and the
mediumship of physical effect, among others.

It is a technical study of great relevance that discloses the ways in which
Spirits act during intricate processes of communication with the incarnate
beings. It conveys concepts of spirituality received from enlightened mentors,
which contain explanations of philosophical, scientific, and evangelical nature,
indispensable to those who are dedicated to the study of mediumship.
