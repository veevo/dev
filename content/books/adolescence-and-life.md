Parents and educators have an imminent commitment to re-evaluate the moral
conduct that should be administered to the new generations in order to prevent
the downfall of our culture and civilization, which are at their somberest
period in history. With this in mind, the spirit Joanna de Ã‚ngelis, by means of
the medium Divaldo Pereira Franco, presents to you here several topics related
to adolescence in the hope of providing some contribution to the thrilling
question that has been challenging all of us, and parents in particular, as to
how we should guide our adolescents.
