This book tells the story of the Spirit Andre K, who in 1995, was given
permission to tell his story, after undergoing years of recovery treatment in
the Spirit realm, which included participating in a weekly seance meeting held
by a group of incarnate mediums. In this group, through the medium Maria Gorete
Newton, he described his tragic death by drug overdose, which took place in
1975, while he was still a teenager living in Zurich, Switzerland. 

It is a richly descriptive narrative for parents, children and society, offering
a glimpse of the afterlife consequences resulting from drug consumption.
