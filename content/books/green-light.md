This book addresses the hidden physiology of the astral body, life in
supraphysical planes, and powers of the soul in freedom in his true homeland. It
deals with music and its effects, from constellation archangels to incarnate
man. Attentive reporter, Atanagildo descend the minutiae about the music that is
grown in the astral spheres such as instruments, genres, composers and
performers.

Excerpts from the introduction to the book (as written by the Spirit,
Emmanuel)²:

> We all know how important it is to have innermost peace, a peace which gives
> us safety.  We are all aware that we have been living in an ocean of mental
> waves with the imperative of adjusting these waves to our own benefit.  It is
> a vast sea of interchanging vibrations, through which we send and receive
> power.  The mind acts based on this inevitable exchanging system…

> This book is a result of research done by a friend who is, presently, a doctor
> in the spiritual.  You will find in this book the blessing of a multitude of
> questions and answers from those who are facing the challenge of life in the
> material world.  These questions and answers point the way to the right path
> in our daily life. It is comparable to a precious list of recommendations to
> ensure innermost health…

> It opens for us a clear pathway wherein we should bear in mind that we need to
> treat others as we would wish to be treated ourselves.  Thinking in this way,
> we can move forward to achieve the plans of elevation and progress, at peace
> with others, and with ourselves, the the power of peace of mind.
