The direction society takes is invariably connected to the destiny of the
family, given that the latter consists of the starting point for experiences of
universal fraternity. In this beautiful work composed of thirty themes, Joanna
de Ângelis offers a profound reflection about the mechanism of the spiritual and
moral development of human beings, emphasizing the value of the family through
corporeal and spiritual ties whose existence is still one of the most important
factors, if not the most significant one, in preventing disintegration of
society.

The venerable Joanna de Ângelis offers distinguished reflections about the
family constellation, presenting the firm position of Spiritism on a theme that
is unfortunately disregarded rather often in our chaotic modern world, and one
which has led to a deterioration of social behavior into egotism and violence,
as evidenced by their consequences to society, a situation that leaves all of us
perplexed and powerless.
