This book is part of an outstanding collection, which includes: The Way, the
Truth and the Life, Living Spring, and Vineyard of Light.  The collection was
written by the spirit Emmanuel, who seeks to guide Spiritists in the practice of
Christian principles, leading them to find in the teachings of Jesus their inner
transformation, which cannot be postponed. 

In the bookâ€™s 180 chapters, the author brilliantly comments on several verses
from the New Testment.  From each page spring the depth of concept and the
lightness of form in which they are outlined.

The spirit author shows Spiritism duly based on the lessons of the New Testament
as being an opportunity for work and growth for those who long for the renewal
of their minds.

Our Daily Bread is nourishment for the spirit, strengthening it for its daily
struggles.
