This novel offers information about the relationship that exists in the
activities of the spirit on the two planes of life. Renewing his interest in our
inner improvement, André Luiz tells the moving story of Amaro, Zulmira, Odila,
and other characters, recounting the events of their previous lives from the
time of Brazil’s War with Paraguay (1864-1870) until the days of old Rio de
Janeiro (early 1900s).

In its preface, Emmanuel assures us that "The basic pictures of the narrative
are intimately familiar to us," such as family dysfunctions, the torment of
jealousy, and the daily struggle for moral progress. Each page of this book
discloses new knowledge and emotions.
