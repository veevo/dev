This book by Yvonne A. Pereira is divided into two parts. In Part One, the
spirit Bezerra de Menezes tells “A Sad Story,” which took place in a
poverty-stricken community in Rio de Janeiro in the 19th century, and where
Palmira, an incarnate spirit, is righting past wrongs by means of trials
entailing selflessness and patience.

In Part Two, Camilo Castelo Branco narrates the touching mediumistic novel “The
Castle Treasure,” set in Portugal in 1640, in which he shows that love and
kindness are indispensable qualities for one’s peace of mind while undergoing
moral reform.

Focusing on the law of Cause and Effect, both narratives spread the Spiritist
principles, thus comforting and informing those suffering the imposition of
harsh trials.
