The Law of Responsibility is an important Divine Law that guides us to
our abilities as immortal spirits, children of God.

Christ himself taught us about her when he told us "Every one according to the
his works."

The mentor Emmanuel also elucidates us in Meeting marked:
> And since Perfect Justice accompanies us and observes in all the steps of the
evolutionary journey, the law of responsibility works in all climates,
determining the merits or needs of every particular person and reducing
all theories of reward and punishment to the wise evangelical precept: "To each
one second to his works."

In the book Among Brothers of Other Lands psychographed by Chico Xavier,
we find this beautiful text teaching us more about this law:

```
The spiritist, heir to superior knowledge, bumps into resentment swells and
sorrows, nurturing perfectly new attitude when put in confrontation
with that of other religious principles. 

Admitting the continuity of life, in addition to death, does not receive sensors in the way
c'.and enemies or irresponsible. Welcomes them as being trans-deviated companions
that you have to recover for good. 

In the face of this, moral assaults present to him relative importance,
while they give you the pans. 

Because i feed hatred of someone, if they are convinced by the law of reincarnation,
that this someone can shelter himself in his arms, in the feature of a loved one
on the family team? 

On the other hand, you cannot ignore the evil of which was object, sure how much you think
of the individual liability law. Given the balanced behaviour that
circumstances suggest to you: serenity without indifference, within which it recognizes
that it is no use wasting time with hidden regrets or misplaced complaints. 

It collects all manifestations of revilia, wickedness, aggression or
misunderstanding of others, with the tranquility of the cultivator who receives from
a fellow vast collections of green fruits, for which there is no placement
in the area of their interests. 

And how do you know that the person responsible for production will be immersed in providing you with fruits
mature, in proper time, waits for them with patience. 

For this reason, if the spiritist uses some effort in the face of attacks from the
path, this rematch is always the most efficient service response to all
challenges that has been targeted.

Let's remember that, ahead of injuries or contempt. 

For us, the words of Christ "love your enemies" and "pray for those who
persecute and slander, "do not mean carte blanche to the brothers who wallow themselves
evil and do not even determine us to exhibit supposed superiority before them. 

They clearly mean that we should not cut the threads of brotherly love that
identify with each other, giving them the right to be responsible for
by the mistakes they practice and that it is up to us to involve them in restorative vibrations
prayer, continuing, on our part, in the undisturbed construction of good, which
will always yield light and truth, joys and blessings for them and for us.
