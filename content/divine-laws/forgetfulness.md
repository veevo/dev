One of the basic postulates of spiritism is that of the plurality of stocks or
Reincarnation.

The evolution of spirits requires countless existences to improve itself because
all are created simple and ignorant.

A frequently raised question refers to the forgetfulness of
past stocks. If we have lived many times on earth, why not
Remember?

It would be detrimental to know our entire past from previous lives or the past
of those around us?

It turns out that the absolute majority of humanity currently has numerous ills
Moral. In other words, our past is not full of noble and beautiful
Actions.

In this context, the forgetfulness of the pastincarnations constitutes a blessing.

It is very common for spirits who have already been in conflict to be united in the same
family in a new incarnation. In such cases, the Law of Forgetfulness is
Fundamental. When a mother or father sees their child for the first time, they have
the ability to love that being infinitely. Without knowing your past or
their vices as a spirit. And this is perfect for evolution and forgiveness:
sorrows of other lives will be overcome in this present life through love. And no
for pain.

Not knowing our past from other lives the moment we embody is something
Essential. In other words, it is the Law of Forgetfulness which allows a
new incarnation is the opportunity we all have to start a new
Cycle. Obviously, we still have to bear errors of other stocks. But the
that we don't know these mistakes or the mistakes of our fellow men causes
the path is easier and less painful.

Under the blessing of forgetfulness, the emotions and fraternal links are refound if
Establish.

So it's not relevant to remember the past.

The important thing is to live the present well.
