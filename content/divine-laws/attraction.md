Affinity consists of the similarity, identity or conformity of tastes,
interests, feelings, purposes, views. In turn, the harmony
is established by virtue of the attraction and sympathy that takes effect between the
parts that maintain affinity. And by the mechanisms of the affinity law, the harmony
constitutes inderogable law. What are the implications, the consequences of that?

Affinity is "a union track" in which we integrate with each other. [1]

In everything, we see integration, affinity, tuning... And one thing we don't have
doubt: through thought, we commune with each other, in full life
universal. [2]

All the things that exist in the Universe live on an affinity basis. Since the
atom to the archangels everything is attraction and harmony.  Nothing that reaches you
existence is occasional or the result of a no-link reaction.

Your free will accurately indicates the position of ocupas in the Cosmos, once
that each individual owes himself the favorable or adverse situation in which the
situation at the present time.

You have come from unconsciousness – simple and ignorant – and, by the law of evolution,
walk to consciousness by choosing the road to be traveled.

You'll find or you're looking.

You have possession of what you gave.

You live with someone you tune in with.

You will know what you have learned, but you will only incorporate into memory what
vivenciaste.

Go ahead or go back to your mental home.

Happiness or unhappiness are by-products of your intimate state.

Friends are long-time choices.

Your home circle is the materialization of your longings and your needs
learning.

For your way of being, you will gain admiration or disregard.

What you do to you today will reflect on your tomorrow, since your yesterday
decided yours today.

With your thoughts, you attract, absorb, boost or reject. With your
willingness, give guidance and direction, pointing to the most varied directions.
Jesus said, "I have asked and will be given to you; search and find; beat and open you"
                                       .

Harmony is the basis of the existence of every immortal soul. Whether in physical life is
in astral life, the law of affinity is divine principle governing you, to all
others and everything.

He notes: living in drama or reality, in affliction or serenity, in the shadow
or in light, it is a posture that is strictly related to your way of feeling,
think and act. [3]

Affinity consists of the similarity, identity or conformity of tastes,
interests, feelings, purposes, views. In turn, the harmony
is established by virtue of the attraction and sympathy that takes effect between the
parts that maintain affinity.

We can learn, from the postulates of the Spiritist Doctrine and its literature, that,
by the provisions of the affinity law, harmony is an inderogable law,
that is, which cannot be abolished, cancelled, eliminated, extinguished.

And what's the implication, the consequence of that? Where do we put thoughts and
feelings, then one will develop our lives, because we live under the
influence of the beliefs and values we feed, the emotions we cultivate,
aspirations and purposes that guide our daily lives.

Whether or not we are aware of this responsibility, each of us is,
constantly attracting the circumstances and persons who, in a way or of
another, come into line with our inner world. So each of us
will always live together and everywhere and at all times with those with whom
in tune, making inevitable energy exchanges. And any change in this
sharing will necessarily depend on the transformation of our condition
intimate, because the forces that bind us to each other are the ones that, first
place, we send from us. In essence, we are what we think and feel – and, for
therefore, what we do – by automatically connecting our world
internal to the external universe, for we are with everyone and in all and everything is in
We.

To paraphrase "tell me who you're seeing and I'll tell you who you are," we'll conclude that,
we just know our real motivations and the nature of our friends, to
to be with whom we wish to resemble.

In this sense, the spirit Emmanuel advocates that, if harmony is mutual agreement,
"all that heart that palpitates and works in the field of Jesus' teachings,
to Jesus will resemble." [4]

Minds commune with minds that resemble them.
Spirits tune in to spirits that are the like.
People sync with people they're buying from. [5]

                                      ***

And in the great Romagem, we are all instruments of the forces with which we are
in tune.

We are all mediums, within the mental field that is our own, associating ourselves
to uplifting energies, if our thought flows towards life
or to the disturbing and depressing forces, if we still enslave ourselves
to the shadows of primitivist or tortured life.

Each creature, with the feelings that characterize his intimate life, emits
and lives in the spiritual wave with which it identifies. [6]

In his Letter to the Hebrews (12:1), the Apostle Paul comments on a "cloud of
witnesses" to surround us, warning us about the moral condition of the
individuals we have for companions. However, they will be only the ones who
find, materially, participating in our family, professional and
social?

According to the teachings brought by Allan Kardec, organizer and encoder of the
Spiritist Doctrine, reality is much broader. By our way of being and
act, not only do we choose the friends and environments of our preference,
as well as attracting individuals living in the spirit world – the spirits
–, as much as we are attracted to them, even if we do not believe or are
aware of this presence.  

In question 484, of The Book of Spirits, we have:
> "Do spirits get a preference for certain people?"

Answer:

> "Good Spirits sympathize with good men, or susceptible to
improve; the inferior Spirits with vicious men or who may come to
be them. Hence his affection, because of the similarity of sensations." [7]

On another occasion, Kardec also commented: "All moral imperfections
are another open-door that they give access to evil spirits." [8]  

Each of us builds, in a very particular way, its own atmosphere
Moral. Disharmony and existential disorders are due to
moral imperfections, and that by the natural processes of affinity and
harmony, attract equally imperfect and unbalanced spirits. And these,
by engaging with their disturbing and sick thoughts the individual who
allows them to suffer harassment, negatively influence the field of will and
discernment of the incarnate, and may push it into difficult situations,
complicated or calamitous.

However, the Spirit Joanna of Angela explains the 'reverse of the medal':

As there are no violence against universal laws, nor privileges for some
individuals to the detriment of others, who pray and seek to be in balance
directs mental waves that reach the happy Regions of Spirituality,
arousing love and interest of spiritual guides, which take place pressurosos
to help him. Thus, they promote unexpected encounters, inspiring one and the other to
take the same path, so that they will face each other in a certain place,
casually, although they have been telementalized in choosing the script.

At other times, a certain aspiration or need to present itself
unlikely, because the mind is in tune with the transcendent world, is
inspired to make such or what decision that will end up resolving the desire.

Repeatedly, small occurrences occur naturally, providing
enchantment and perhaps, who enrich with hope and gratitude he who is
Elected. [9] 

Tuning in is to be at the same mental-emotional frequency as others, and may
capture and send thoughts simultaneously. In this way, tune in with the
spirits is to predisposing themselves to psychic contact with them in a way that
conscious or unconscious. 

Each individual assimilates the upper or lower forces with which
Identifies. That is why Jesus recommended vigilance and prayer as
antidotes against unbalanced suggestions, so many of the incarnated
as of the disembodied. 

## Tune with superior spirits
In order to tune with the superior spirits, we must blur the thought and
feeling of what is bothering us or leaving us restless,
in order to capture other ideas available to our consciousness. Hence the
importance of learning to discipline thoughts by exercising hygiene
mental reflections and prayer, for these are the ones that
allow the change/elevation of our intimate state. However, cultivating good
thoughts and feelings during prayer is not simply building good
ideas at the moment you want to connect with disembodied spirits
focused on good, but also establish a personal lifestyle that favors
of course the emergence of both. So the one who is ethical and works
continuously in the exercise of his amorosity obviously that has by
witnesses the spirits of love and peace, and who assist him in his trajectory
evolution, for if it is true that everyone can only give according to what he has,
becomes obvious that each one receives according to what he gives. 

## Good thoughts
Good thoughts contribute to harmony with Good Spirits. Good
feelings strengthen the individual's connection with those spirits, to the extent
in which they were built on the basis of goodness and love. The amorosity of the person
is one of the safest ways to build superior feelings. [10]


## Mental range
In the mental range in which you operate, it is natural that you receive messages with the same
vibratory content as it sends them.

Who aspires to moral and spiritual elevation, tunes with superior vibrations,
vigorous stimuli are made, producing inner harmony and renewal.

(...) Those who linger in pessimism, acalating failures, assimilates waves
which carry pestilential miasms, fixing them to the panels of the
emotion, which generate imbalances and illnesses.

(...) Happiness begins in the act of desiring it.

The desdita begins the instant you give you shelter.

Use the time well, all doing so that your next moment is to you
always more promising and enjoyable.

What you can't reach now, insisting, you'll get it later.

Therefore, it elects the ideals of human aggrandizement and never stop.
[11]


We urgently make ourselves aware of our condition of immortal spirits, and that, as
should be achieved by incorporating the highest principles and
values of morality and amorosity.

When Allan Kardec, in The Gospel according to Spiritism, by guidance of the
Superior Spirits, stressed the importance of the study [12], did not do so with the
purpose of being too intellectualized, especially in order to demonstrate
to others the superiority of our capacity and intelligence, but so that,
through the knowledge gained, we learned to select what
truly contribute dwell to our intimate enrichment. The
intimate reeducation takes us out of idleness, brings light to the spirit, harmonizes the
how it enables the approximation of the spirits interested in our
ventura.


According to spirit André Luiz, our soul can be compared to mirror
quality of absorption and exteriorization. We collect the strength of life in
waves of thought and express them through words, examples,
Attitudes.

They rightly proceeded those who compared our mental world to a
Mirror.

We reflect the images that surround us and throw in the direction of others the
images we created.

And since we cannot escape the imperative of attraction, we will only portray the
clarity and beauty, if we install beauty and clarity in the mirror of our
intimate life.

Mental reflexes, according to their nature, favor us from stagnation or
drive the journey forward, because every human creature lives in heaven or
in hell which built for herself, in the recesses of the heart and of the
consciousness, regardless of the physical body, because, observing life in
its essence of glorious eternity, death is only worth as a transition between
two types of the same experience, in "today imperecible". [13]  



                                      ***



- 278. Are the Spirits of different orders mixed?

Yes and no; I mean, they see each other, but they're different from each other. They get
avoid or approach according to the analogy or sympathy of their feelings
as is the case between you. It's a whole world yours is the dark reflection.
Spirits of the same category come together for a kind of affinity and form
groups or families of Spirits united by the sympathy and objective to which
they proposed: the good for the desire to do good, the bad for doing evil,
for the shame of their faults and the need to find themselves among those who
resemble them.

Such a great city where men of all categories and of all
conditions see each other and meet without being confused; where societies form
by the analogy of tastes; where addiction and virtue coexist without speaking. [7]



According to the information compiled by Allan Kardec in the spirit world,
spirits are organized according to their evolutionary levels and by the similarity of
purposes and interests. As they evolve and change their situation, they still
group with those who are in the same range of evolution. In life
material, also the incarnates are sought for the affinities and, in general, perform
their tasks according to their motivations.



We all have a favorite circle of friendship. These are the affinities resulting from
experiences lived in common: shared acts of love; wounds opened by
some, but healed by the friendship and care of others; problems in
require the union of efforts to be resolved; commitments of
reciprocal aid... For a pleasant existence, it is essential to live together
with people who understand life in a similar way to ours, who seek the
same goals as ours, who profess the same religiosity... All
this is quite natural and should be cultivated.



However, none of this prevents us from establishing a good relationship with others,
participating in facts and actions alongside them. After all, living with the differences
helps us to grow, to develop our potential for understanding and
acceptance towards those who do not cultivate the same tastes, interests,
feelings, purposes and views. How much tranquility we could
enjoy if we just learned to get rid of the vision of charming ourselves the best,
the always correct, of being but the owner of the truth, at least its best
Interpreter. It would be easier to accept ourselves and the other.



It is in the home that spirits are reborn together by affinities and, above all, by
atoning contingencies, because the family is the main body
conflict-debugger of the past. It is in which old loves and old people gather
disaffected, an environment in which spirits have the opportunity to exercise the
forgiveness and love in the most diverse aspects.



According to spiritist postulates, because blood ties do not always
gather the souls essentially the like, the component of the family that with us
relates and with which we do not have affinity or even feel a certain aversion, it is
always someone whom we have to learn to understand and accept in our own
Benefit. And acceptance does not consist of agreement with its inadequate
attitudes, but in the willingness to help him overcome his difficulties,
notably, the intimate ones.



In question 204, of The Spirits Book, Allan Kardec questions the
Greater Spirituality:

"Since we have had several stocks, the parentage dates back beyond our
current existence?"



Answer:

"It can't be any other way. The succession of bodily stocks establishes
between spirits bonds that date back to previous existences. Hence, many
sometimes the causes of sympathy between you and certain Spirits that
they seem strange." [7]


And in The Gospel according to Spiritism, the encoder notes:

The Spirits form, in space, groups or families united by affection, by
sympathy and the similarity of the inclinations; these Spirits, happy to
be together, seek each other; the incarnation does not separate them but momentarily,
because, after their re-entry into erraticity, they meet again, as friends at the
return of a trip. Often even, they follow in the incarnation, where
gather in the same family, or in the same circle, working together
for your mutual advance. If some are incarnate and others are not,
nor are they less united by thought; those who are free fleece
on those who are captive; the most advanced seek to advance the
Stragglers. After each existence, they took a step in the path of
perfection; less and less related to matter, their affection is more alive, because
even to be more debugged, no longer disturbed by selfishness, nor by the clouds
of passions. They can therefore go through an unlimited number of stocks
without any harm affecting their mutual affection.

It is understood that it is about the real affection of soul to soul, the only one who
survives the destruction of the body, because beings who do not unite in this world
but by the senses, they have no reason to seek out in the world of
Spirits. There is no durable but spiritual affections; affections
carnais are extinguished by the cause that caused them to be born; now, this cause does not exist
more in the spirit world, while the soul always exists. As for the
people united by the only mobile of interest, they're not really at all
united to each other: death separates them upon earth and in heaven.

The union and affection that exist among relatives are an indication of sympathy
previous approached them; also it is said, speaking of a person whose character,
tastes and inclinations have no resemblance to those of their relatives, who
she's not family. That said, it is more true than you think.  
God allows, in families, these incarnations of unsympathetic Spirits or
strangers, with the dual objective of serving as proof for some and medium of
advance for others. The bad ones improve little by little to the contact of the good
and for the care they receive from him; his character slows down, his customs
debug and their dislikes fade; this is how the merger between
different categories of Spirits, as occurs on earth, between races and
People. [14]





                                      13

                                  Us and Jesus



Taking stock, through reflections, you are impelled to renew concepts, face to
the need to place the Lord in many of his positions and that
You've been denying it.



Not very often, afraid and disillusioned, interrogates, falsely concluding, which
recording unfortunate response, due to the intimate dryness that suffers.



If you have not yet convinced yourself of the need to tune in with Him, complete the
reasoning, putting him present and you will notice differences.



You mention tiredness and imbalance as a burden that overlaps, overwhelming, almost
leading you to failure. However, "The burden is light!"



You say the friendship of friends has moved from yours to strange provinces. In
result you suffer the emptiness that remained in the soul, thanks to their defection. In
however: "He who does not take his cross and follows me is not worthy of me."



You clarify that the monotony of activities gradually and little kills the burning of the ideal
that i'd open you up before. You have a feeling that it's no longer the same flame of faith,
that burned in you. Nevertheless: "The worker of the untenth hour lives up to the
salary of that first hour."



You inform that you would like new signs of heaven, so that the
convictions that seem emptied of content in the torrpe consumer society.

Without embargo, the lesson is simple: "those who have not seen and believed."



Undermined by insistent illnesses that rob you of vitality, inquires: "Where
divine help, in the direction of my needs?" Nevertheless, the answer
is uttered for almost two thousand years: "Not all have been healed."



The hunger round is increasing, expanding the dimensions of its
and sovereign misery governs millions of destinations. Kill the
your eyes, in fair compuntion. In the heart, you ask, "Why does the Lord not solve
the difficulty?"



Meanwhile, the elucidation has already been given: "Not only man lives..."

Yes, it's hours of inner swing, time to harvest the result of sowing.

Each emotionally breathes the climate of the psychic province in which the
Aspirations.



Man reaches the destination that buys him, and ideal, in him, has vitality
that the supply of sacrifice gives him, through whom he sustains it.



You are part of the family that constitutes the flock of Christ. The Lord continues the

Same. Take a rational and honest examination in order to check whether the change, for
chance, it wouldn't have been your part.



The course he points to us continues to indicate freedom. The moorings were

constructed by each one, for spiritual slavery itself.



In the face of such considerations, in the balm of the tormenting days, it is appropriate to consult
Jesus, without ceasing, and, if you have ears able to listen to him, discerning,
You will perceive it to repeat: "I am the Way: Come to me!" [15]







The conscious Spirit, however, although subjected to the laws that preside over the
you have with it the light of reason that gives you the choice.



Human intelligence, incarnate or disembodied, can contribute, by the power
will, education or re-education of oneself, selecting the
resources capable of promoting improvement.



Mental reflection in man can thus grow in amplitude and sublimate in
beauty to absorb in itself the projection of Superior Thinking.

It will all depend on our purpose and decision.



While we buy ourselves with ignorance or with indifference to the
principles that govern us, we are surrounded without defensive by thoughts of
all kinds, often in the form of monstrosities and crimes, in pictures
that rob us the imagination or in inarticulate voices that swarm us to the
acoustics of the spirit, leading us to the darkest angles of suggestion.



That's why we noticed so many people in the taste of the circumstances, accepting
both good and evil, truth and lies, hope and doubt,
certainty and denial, in the way of steering wheel sheet in the wind.



Let us educate ourselves, studying and meditating, to reflect divine inspiration.

Let us remember that the automatic impulse of the arm lifting the homicidal blade
can be perfectly equal, in motion, to that of the one who raises a book
enobrecedor.



The mental attitude makes a difference.



Our thoughts thirst for elevation, so that our existence is
Raise.

We build balance and discernment in us.



We yield unceasing worship to kindness and understanding.



We usually contemplate in the mirror of the soul of our own image, and,
for this reason, we collect from others the reflection of ourselves or else that
part of others that harmonizes with our way of being.



It is not enough to our happiness unilateral acquisitions of virtue or values
Incomplete.



We're all hungry for fullness.



Desire is the magnet of life.



Desiring, we feel, and, by feeling, our soul assimilates what it seeks and
transmits what you receive.



Let us therefore learn to want the best, to reflect the best in our ascension
to God. [16]
