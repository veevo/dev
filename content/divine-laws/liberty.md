## Freedom
common sense â€” each one's faculty to act or decide according to their own
without submitting to the will of one of the other.

## Freedom, thought and action
Between will and thought one must place the freedom to think, and between the
thought and action, the freedom to act is placed.

## Freedom in the law of men
The largest law (constitution of a country) guarantees freedom of association,
trade, thought, meeting, industrial, politics, professional, locomotion
(go, come or stay) etc.

## Unlimited Freedom
There are no limitations to freedom of thought while not externalized. All
individual is free to think what he wants, because he enjoys unlimited freedom,
in this field. He only responds before God.

## Natural freedom
as emanation of God's will, man enjoys natural freedom, but not of
freedom, this because it needs the similar. 

Say the spirits: "as long as there are two men together, there are rights to respect
and they will not therefore have absolute freedom. (q. 826). When someone says
"liberal", with airs of kindness, but acts despotically, in the family or in the
occupations of life, is that selfishness and pride are still companions to him
Inseparable.

## Freedom and slavery
Slavery is an evil, for it is an abuse of force, which contradicts the
law of God (natural law of freedom), will disappear with the moral progress of the
Man. Even when, due to the inequality of skills, some are placed in the
dependence on others, this should serve for elevation, for learning, to
that what knows most help what knows less. So not being the man treated
as a thing, as a commodity, as a machine, but how to be gifted with spirit.
all progress, and there will be no moral or physical degradation.

## Freedom of conscience
According to the book of spirits (q. 835), "consciousness is a thought
which belongs to man like all thoughts." Thus, men (and
states) have no right to oppose freedom of conscience or to
guidelines, for god alone is it up to God to judge the conscience of men.
enlighten the spirits (q. 837): "freedom of conscience is one of the
characteristics of true civilization and progress."

## Free will
It's the same as freedom to think and freedom to act. Without free will the
man would be a robot, simple machine, guided at a distance. I have my
free will, granted by God, and which allows me, inwardly, to choose the
form of my thoughts, words and my deeds. 

For free will, I am fiscal myself, I polish my shares, having
as barriers only the moral brakes, which, if well regulated by me, me
allow so-called self-control, even when tempted to do something that does not
Should. By free will, man is lord of his will, answering by the
their acts, in this and other lives, by the principle of action and reaction, of cause and
effect, arising from laws of nature (of God).

## Free will, fatality and human actions
Fatality does not exist; it is the spirit, in carnating, who chooses his ordeal. The
future is not made known to man, so that he does not neglect the present. The
acts that practice, good or evil, are reflections of their moral and spiritual evolution.
everything is in it.
