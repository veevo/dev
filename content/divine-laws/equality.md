Equality is the state of what is equal; is the similarity of characters or
Components.

Equality before law and justice refers to equal protection and
punishment, for the guarantee of rights or the imposition of coercive rules, which
Force.

## Moral Equality
Equality in the face of morality concerns the relationship between individuals, a relationship between
whereby all have fundamental (natural) rights, born from the
humanity, defining what is worthy of the human person.

## Natural equality
(of nature, god's work). Before God, all men are equal, for the
divine laws cover the totality of things, since "the sun was born to
all of them." Thus, the rich and the poor; the wise and the illiterate; black and white; All
are subject, by natural laws, to pain and physical death. There is no
natural superiority to anyone.

## Time equality
(state, man). "all are equal before the law, without distinction of
any nature..." (this is what ensures our constitution in Article 5
"caput"; repeats the commandment of the "universal declaration of human rights", of
1948). Everyone (Brazilians and foreigners residing in the country are guaranteed to
inviolability of the rights to life, freedom, security and property.

## Inequality of skills
God created the equal spirits, but as each one lived more or lived less, and
carried out greater or lesser quantity of works, there are the necessary gaps, in order to
that they together complete themselves: some, doing more, helping, teaching;
others, needing, receiving, learning. "thus the diversity of skills
of man does not relate to the intimate nature of his creation, but with the degree
improvement to which he has come as a spirit." By necessity,
men unite.

## Social inequalities
Social inequalities do not stem from natural laws (laws of nature), but
of the laws of men, with their selfish customs. For divine law, there is no
"noble blood" or "blue blood", neither "poor blood" or "commoner's blood"; No
there are "lords" (noble snores) and vassals or slaves. 

Only the spirit is purer or less pure, because of its progress, because of the
his effort. The division by school, tradition, clothing, position
is the work of man, due to his moral delay. Not always the
illiterate is at a gap with the bearer of letter titles, for what
account are moral titles.

## Wealth inequality
Before talking about rich people, one must know the origin of wealth and how it is
being employed, because "equality of wealth is not possible", for it would be
think of material equality, only. What if it comes from crimes and misery so on?
"God experiences the poor by resignation and the rich by the use he makes of his
goods."

## Equality of man and woman
Before divine law, the spirit is only differentiated by its degree of evolution, not
by the body, which is a passenger shelter.

## Tomb equality
Marble and bronze do not elevate the corpse to the superior condition of the one who to the
times, he was not even buried, but that defaced because of morally noble cause.
