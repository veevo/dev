Since the natural state is the return to primitivism, it is soon seen that man does not
can go backward in its evolution and, as spirits teach, the natural state is
and man leaves him for progress and civilization; for as law
governs every human condition, man progresses as better as better
understands and best practices this law. 

"Man develops by himself, of course, but not everyone progresses to the
at the same time and in the same way; that's then the earliest ones help others
progress, through social contact."

## Moral progress and intellectual progress
although intellectual progress can help moral progress, the two do not
walk in parallel. By intellect, man, more easily, distinguishes the
good of evil, the right of wrong. Thus, by the development of intelligence,
having man the free will granted by God, he now has greater
Responsibilities. 

When individuals or peoples are found more intellectually savvy and,
however, more perverted, is because complete progress requires time, it is
done step by step. But even so, no one can stop the march of progress,
"because it is a condition of human nature."

## Degenerate peoples, human legislation and influence of spiritism on progress
Degenerate peoples will progress through pain, suffering and reach
perfection, because God does not help anyone. Human legislation will progress with
the moral elevation of man. Spiritism, making man know himself
even, by reincarnation, shows you the path of progress.
