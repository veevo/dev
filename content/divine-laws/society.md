Life in society is a Natural Law, for for this, God has given man
all colleges. Even because, instinctively, beings discover that
need to help each other. Alone, man would not have the ability to put in
exercise all your faculties. And it is by the union that beings are completed,
materially and spiritually, and thus evolve. 

Even the life of isolation is justified only if it is intended for the help of those who suffer
or the ones who know the least. 

Also the vow of silence, no doubt, contradicts the law of God, for it deprives the
man to maintain social relations and thus not doing good (nor himself)
parks and does not progress.

## Family ties
As bem clarifiece or Prof. Herculano Pires, or philosopher Herbert Spencer
considered the family among the institutions that form social life; The
marx and engels philosophers classify it as the first historical group, the
first form of human interaction; Augusto Comte, father of Sociology, saw in
family the basic cell of society, understanding that perfect society is the
that works like family. 

in the book of spirits (q. 774), family ties constitute a law
natural, because "social relations are necessary for progress and the
family members summarize social relations." by divine will, men must
learn "to love ones as brothers." 

Animals have material and non-moral life, and family care is only
an instinct for conservation and not a means to progress.

## The two great societies of the earth
The family, as a seed forming of society, and the State as an institution
organizing policy of society. It is therefore the case that, in a process,
natural nature, man himself feels it is essential to maintain and retain society
to progress, individually and collectively. 

For Spiritism, society exists for the moral elevation of man, for the
their inner growth, so that he may learn to be fraternal and indulgent, in his
benefit and in the whole.
