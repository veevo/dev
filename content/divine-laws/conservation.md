As life is necessary for the improvement of beings, instinct rests in the Law
of nature, being mechanical for some (irrational) and rational for other
(men).

## Means of conservation
As everything God does is perfect, the earth allows man in it to produce
the goods of their needs. Thus, the man imprevidente, lazy or
destroyer cannot accuse Nature of drought, excessive rain, or by the
damage he does himself. "Search and find" and "every one according to his works"
"taught Jesus. The goods of the Earth are all that man can enjoy, but without
sweat of selfishness. The earthly vices are of men and not nature, which is
Perfect.

## Attraction of land goods
They teach spirits: there is an attraction for things in the back, to test the
Man. Even when the livelihoods don't depend on man, there's him there
evidence to which he must submit before nature. and submit to the will to
God is growing spiritually. Man excesses place him below the
Animals. Trials make man grow, intellectually and morally. See
that many of our ancestors died of simple flu. It was for the
suffering that man sought and found a cure for tuberculosis, malaria,
syphilis, measles, yellow fever and so many evils. See polio that,
until recently, there were many disabled; today, with Sabin vaccine, one has its
Eradication. It was the pain that taught man to search.

## Physical death and moral death
By losing himself in excesses, on the pretext of enjoying life, man approaches the
physical death and moral death at the same time. The Book of Spirits, Q. 714-A,
says: "Animals are limited to meeting their needs. Man abdicates the
reason that God has given him and exceeds him. Diseases, decay, death even, which
are a consequence of abuse, they are the punishment of the transgression of the Law of God." The
vices of society come from ambition and pride.

## Necessary and superfluous
Nature does not set limits on man; expects him, by his free will,
know what is needed, according to reason. If he wants the superfluous, you know
that this is lacking in others. "Those who live at the expense of the deprivations of others
exploit the benefits of civilization for their own benefit." (L. E., Q. 717).
Where is the Charity Act in them? What about the love of others?

## Deprivations and mortifications
The deprivations of man are only important to God if they are beneficial to
others; privations of useless pleasures are also meritorious. The search for the
well-being is man's right, for his effort, but without prejudice to the similar.
Not feeding and suffering deliberately without aiding the like, is useless
before God; it is not used to the elevation of the Spirit.
