Worship, according to philologists is "to worship or revere a divinity, or to an
entity, or to a being." It comes from the Latin "adorae", from where the "ad"
preposition is born, indicating approximation, in relation to space and time,
and the term "oratio", referring to the faculty of speaking, joining the word
"oratus", with the meaning of supplication. 

Thus, worship is, at the same time, a form of approximation and dialogue, for
words or thought, with the being to which worship is surrendered, being a form
of cause the supplication to come until revered.

## Worship through the ages
There was always the feeling of worship in man. Often, this was born of the
ignorance, blending idolatry (worship of idols) with the unknown. 

In Prof. Herculano Pires' book The Spirit and Time we see THE WORSHIP through
horizons (vision of men): 

1) Tribal Horizon (rudimentary worship, fear of the unknown); 

2) Agricultural Horizon (Heaven is the Father God and the earth is the Mother Goddess; with rain and
heat, one fertilized the other and production was born); 

3) Civilized Horizon
(cult of bosses, respected as gods, although still cultivated,
reservedly, worship of mystical entities); 

4) Prophetic horizon (phase of the prophets of the Bible, with the formulation of judgments
ethical, the concept of The One God, Supreme); 

5) Spiritual Horizon (by study and reasoning, the THREE
REVELATIONS and their meaning, showing that man is always subject to the
progress as a law of natural evolution: 

1st Moses and his Decalogue, saying NO to the wrong things and promising punishment of
GOD; 

2nd Jesus Christ and his Teachings, saying YES to the right things and
preaching LOVE; 

3rd the Revelation of spirits, through the Kardecist Codification, explaining the
WHY NO and YES. In everything, there is natural evolution. Man has feeling
innate to WORSHIP.  Act of Worship is Natural.

## Purpose of worship
Spiritism shows that one of the Natural Laws is the Act of Worship. This Law
Natural, as we have seen in previous class, does not depend on the will of man, but
of God's designs. In the excellent sense, in the highest spiritual significance,
WORSHIP consists of raising thought to God, because that is the means by
man seeks to bring his soul closer to the Creator Father. The purpose of worship
That's it.

## Outer worship and contemplative worship
They teach spirits that worship for acts of pretense, only to please
in the eyes of the circumstitists, has no meaning, for "the true
worship is of the heart." The eventual outer worship, by gestures or apparatus and
that everyone may see, it will only be accepted by God if it comes from the heart and is intended to
uplifting moral example. It will be worth saying "I love Christ", keeping the
pride, envy, ambition and jealousy, even if external acts are committed
taught by religion. Similarly, practicing CONTEMPLATIVE WORSHIP, not
doing evil and just thinking of God, but remaining static, with nothing
realize, is to turn stone. It is not enough to avoid evil; you have to do good, so as not to
be useless. Praying, only, does not grow the Spirit, if it is not prayer
accompanied by acts of love, charity, fraternity, work, according to
the power of each one.

## Sacrifice as a form of worship
Kill animals even men, to please God, only among late beings.
God does not accept the sacrifice of innocent people. Even the so-called "Holy Wars",
made in the name of God, were and are works of evil Spirits, for God wants the
forgiveness for the ignorant, and i support the afflicted, and may the "man love the next
like himself."

# # Prayer worship
Asking, praising or thanking you, it is for sincere Prayer, for thoughts,
words, which we demonstrate our understanding of what worship so is to God.
By Prayer, through the good Spirits, we are served by God. Prayer with faith
it is energy that brings light to the heart and leads to GOD.
