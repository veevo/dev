"Without charity there is no salvation," said the teachers spirit. The
greatest instrument for us to free ourselves from our past mistakes and progress
morally it is through charity, benevolence for each and indulgence. 

It's only when one is showing charity to others that one is putting in
lessons learned and deserving the blessings that come with progress. 

## The word charity
(The Spirits' Book, question 886) — has the sense of "benevolence towards
all, indulgence towards the imperfections of those of the other, forgiveness of offenses." 

"Charity, according to Jesus, is not restricted to almsgiving, but covers all
relationships with our fellow men, whether it is our inferior, equal
or higher. she tells us to be indulgent because we need to
indulgence, and forbids us to humiliate misfortune, contrary to what commonly
practices itself..." (because outside of charity there is no salvation—gospel).

a) benevolence (seek to be kind and persist in good, always); 
b) devoteement (conscious dedication, without waiting for reward);
