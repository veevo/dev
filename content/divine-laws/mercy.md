Mercy is the complement of softness, since he who is not
merciful cannot be bland and peaceful. Mercy consists of the
forgetfulness and forgiveness of offenses, which is proper to high souls, who
hover above the blows that may give them. (Gospel second
Spiritism, chapter X, items 1 through 4.)

Mercy is one of the main divine virtues. It is she who demonstrates the
infinite goodness of God that always grants us opportunities for reparation of
our own mistakes.

Mercy represents the invitation to peace. Being merciful, we understand
the other - in his own existential moment - and we do not demand from him any
attitude "according to" our aspirations and desires. Otherwise, with a
indulgent positioning, we learn that each is the inheritance of himself and reacts
or manifests itself according to your baggage and trajectory.

If we respect the other as it is, we avoid confrontation and therefore the
Clash. This does not mean, however, that we cannot argue, that is,
talk in a serene and harmonious climate, including going through the possible
differences of understanding. The debate matters the presentation of ideas and points
that may be different, but which they may represent,
further ahead the maturing of certain visions and interpretations, so that
salutary, in the sequence of the evolutionary path.

## How to exercise virtue
To exercise virtue, what matters is to understand mercy as the perennial
willingness to pardon the offenses of the other.

Be, therefore, merciful with your interlocutor so that his mercy
also reach you when it is necessary!

## The lesson of Jesus
Jesus, the model and guide of humanity taught us mysercorn in various
passages of his gospel.

In Lucas:

> "Be merciful as merciful is your Father. Don't judge and you won't be
Judged. Do not condemn and you will not be convicted. Forgive and you will be forgiven. Dai
and it will be given to you." Jesus (Lk; 6:36-38).

At the conclusion of the narration of the parable "The GOOD Samaritan":

> "Which, therefore, of these three seems to you the next one who fell into the hands of the
Robbers? He said, What you used mercy towards him. I said, yes,
Jesus: Go, and do it the same way." (Luke, 10:36 and 37.)

In the Sermon on the Mountain: "Blessed are the merciful, for they
will achieve mercy."

Above, however, of any preaching, jesus gave us the living example of his immense
healing mercy, distancing obsessive spirits from their victims,
comforting afflicted.

So he went down the hill, after the Sermon, healing a leper who worshipped him
saying, "Lord, if you want, you can make me clean. And Jesus, extending his hand,
touched him saying, I want; Be clean. And soon he was cleaned up from leprosy."

In Capernaum, he responded to the appeal of a Roman centurion and healed his distance
employee who lay at home paralyzed and tormented.

He restored the health of Peter's mother-in-law who soon left his bed and made his
household chores.

Arrival in the afternoon, brought him several bemonited and He cast out the spirits
restoring the mental balance of those unfortunate sick.

Still in Capernaum, he healed a paralytic and commanded, "Get up, take your bed
and go home."

When he left, two blind men followed him by shouting, "You have compassion on us,
son of David." Touched in the eyes by the blessed hand of Jesus, the blind
they came to see.

Many are examples of the Lord's infinite goodness, of His compassion for
Helpless.

## The lesson of Spiritism
Following in the Master's footsteps, the Doctrine of Spirits adopted the motto "Outside the
charity there is no salvation, "which comes to awaken in every heart the feeling of
love of others, stimulate the will to serve, make us merciful before
the misfortunes of others.
