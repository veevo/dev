## Necessary and abusive destruction
What we call destruction is just transformation, with the aim of renewal
and improvement of beings. You shouldn't destroy the being ahead of time. "The man
must seek to prolong your life to fulfill your task." (L. E., Q. 730). The
natural destructive agents serve as elements of balance of nature.
When man destroys beyond food and safety needs, he overcomes
the animal stores moral debts and thus parks its evolution
Spiritual. For the imprecautionary and vanity.

## Scourges and wars
The scourges (hunger, plague, weather, fatal floods) are hits of the
nature and serve as warnings to men (social security and improvement). The
wars, ambition or lack of understanding of God's Law, are intended for the
progress of morally delayed man (by pain); the culprits for the wars
will need various incarnations to atone for their faults.

## Murder, cruelty, duel and death penalty
Killing someone is paying attention to the Natural Law; practicing cruelty is typical of the
Late spirits; the duel is murder or suicide: it hurts the Law of God; the penalty
of death represents the involution of society-state, is the return to the "tooth by
tooth -- eye for an eye."
