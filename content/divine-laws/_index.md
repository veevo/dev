## Introduction
Natural law, divine law, is comprised of the unchanging, eternal laws that
govern the universe  ̶  both the laws of nature that govern our physical realm,
and which are studied by our scientific researchers, as well as the ethical
laws, or rules for proper, moral action, the essence of which is contained in
the instruction to love your neighbor and do for him what you'd wish for you.  

God's law is written in the conscience of each one of us, but over time, has
been forgotten or misunderstood, which is why it must be revealed to us once
again.  The sprits tell us that, one day, everyone will fully comprehend the
law, for that is the destiny toward which progress is inevitably leading us¹.

For the purposes of study, Kardec inquired, in Question 684 of "The Spirits'
Book, about dividing the natural law into a number of parts, the names of which
he offered suggestions for.  The Spirits answered that just as Moses divided the
law into 10 parts, he too could create his own system, but added that his
suggested division represented only another classification scheme.  They also
pointed out that the last "part" Kardec suggested, entitled Justice, Love, and
Compassion is the most important and includes all the others.

## Classifications of Law
We can classify the Universal Laws in:

* Scientific Law — The one that establishes between facts, measurable
  relationships universal and necessary, allowing predictions to be made. E.g.:
  "water boils at 100º c"; "two bodies cannot occupy at the same time the same
  place in the space."
* Moral Law — Set of principles or rules relating to human conduct.
* Law of Logic or Thought — Concerning reasoning. E.g.: principle of identity;
  principle of contradiction, etc.

## Natural Laws
Natural Laws have always existed: they are as old as the god. In antiquity,
although the great philosophers did not express it verbatim, we can read them
between the lines of their discourses. Socrates and Plato said that man should
act according to his conscience, that is, practice the virtues that is nothing
more than to choose fairly the good and whether separate from evil. In the
political field, Plato spoke of an ideal state, in which wisest ones should
govern because they are the most knowledgeable of these laws of Nature.

It refers to both physical law and moral law. It regulates all events in the
universe. They are eternal laws, immutable, are not subject to the time, nor to
the circumstance, although they have in themselves the element of progress.

But how does the man do to meet her? There are two basic elements: unit and
Universality. The mathematical law in which two plus two are four exists
throughout the place of the universe. It's up to time and space.

## Physical Laws
There are several phenomena that science should seek answers, because everything
revolves around assumptions that emanate from the human mind. Thus, over time,
many sciences appeared to give answers to the most diverse questions. To
physical phenomena arose physical, astronomical, astronomy, psychological,
psychology and so on.

Science is dedicated to knowing the universal and necessary phenomena, using
always increasingly sophisticated instruments. However, she is powerless to
prove metaphysical phenomena such as the existence of God and immortality of the
soul. 

When you do it ends up falling into scientificism, which is to reduce everything
to proof of science, having it as the salvation of humanity. This is the case of
the doctor that by opening the patient's brain and finding nothing, he ended up
stating that the Spirit does not exist.

## Moral laws
In parallel with the physical law, which is responsible for the particular
sciences to seek the explanations, we have moral laws. These belong to the soul
and concern the notions of good and evil. It's up to Spiritism to unwind them.

### Where are moral laws written?
In question 621 of The Book of Spirits - Where is God's law written? The
Spirits respond that it is written in the consciousness of the being.
they say there is a need to be remembered because we had forgotten it.

How do you understand that the law is written on our conscience? 

According to the doctrinal principles, encoded by Allan Kardec, were created
simple and ignorant, subject to progress. In this sense, the Spirit André Luiz,
in the book Evolution in Two Worlds explains to us that in the mineral kingdom
we receive the attraction; in the plant kingdom the sensation; in the animal
kingdom instinct; in the kingdom hominal continuous thought, free will and
reason. 

They are the prodoms of moral law, whose goal is to transform men into "angels",
"archangels" and "cherubim." It is the potentiation of the virtualities of each
being.
