According to the dictionary, law can be defined as: norm, precept, principle,
rule; obligation imposed by conscience and society.

In general, it is the expression of a causal relationship of a necessary nature, which
between two events or phenomena is established.

## Classifications of Law
We can classify universal laws into 4 types:

* Scientific Law — The one that establishes between facts, measurable relationships
universal and necessary, allowing predictions to be made. E.g.: "water
boils at 100º c"; "two bodies cannot occupy at the same time the same place in the
space."

* Moral Law — Set of principles or rules relating to human conduct.

* Law of Logic or Thought — Concerning reasoning. E.g.: principle of
identity; principle of contradiction, etc.

## Natural Laws
Natural Laws have always existed: they are as old as the
god. In antiquity, although the great philosophers did not express it
verbatim, we can read them between the lines of their discourses. Socrates and
Plato said that man should act according to his conscience, that is,
practice the virtues that is nothing more than to choose fairly the good and whether
separate from evil. In the political field, Plato spoke of an ideal state, in which
wisest ones should govern because they are the most knowledgeable of these laws of
Nature.

It refers to both physical law and moral law. It regulates all
events in the universe. They are eternal laws, immutable, are not subject to the
time, nor to the circumstance, although they have in themselves the element of progress.

But how does the man do to meet her? There are two basic elements: unit and
Universality. The mathematical law in which two plus two are four exists throughout
the place of the universe. It's up to time and space.

## Physical Laws
There are several phenomena that science should seek answers, because everything revolves around
assumptions that emanate from the human mind. Thus, over time, many
sciences appeared to give answers to the most diverse questions. To
physical phenomena arose physical, astronomical, astronomy,
psychological, psychology and so on.

Science is dedicated to knowing the universal and necessary phenomena, using
always increasingly sophisticated instruments. However, she is powerless to
prove metaphysical phenomena such as the existence of God and immortality
of the soul. 

When you do it ends up falling into scientificism, which is to reduce everything
to proof of science, having it as the salvation of humanity. This is the case of
the doctor that by opening the patient's brain and finding nothing, he ended up
stating that the Spirit does not exist.

## Moral law
In parallel with the physical law, which is responsible for the particular sciences to seek the
explanations, we have moral laws. These belong to the soul and concern the notions
of good and evil. It's up to Spiritism to unwind them.

## Where are moral laws written?
In question 621 of The Book of Spirits - Where is God's law written? The
Spirits respond that it is written in the consciousness of the being.
they say there is a need to be remembered because we had forgotten it.

How do you understand that the law is written on our conscience? 

According to the doctrinal principles, encoded by Allan Kardec, were created
simple and ignorant, subject to progress. In this sense, the Spirit André Luiz,
in the book Evolution in Two Worlds explains to us that in the mineral kingdom
we receive the attraction; in the plant kingdom the sensation; in the animal
kingdom instinct; in the kingdom hominal continuous thought, free will and
reason. 

They are the prodoms of moral law, whose goal is to transform men into "angels",
"archangels" and "cherubim." It is the potentiation of the virtualities of each
being.
