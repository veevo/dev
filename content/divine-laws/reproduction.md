Reproduction is the same as multiplication, repetition, renewal, transformation.
Thus, reproducing is the same as multiplying; especially animals and
vegetables multiply.
correct idea of what this means: growing physically and spiritually and
multiply in number and knowledge. The progressive transformation of
species gives the primary sense of reproduction; but this, as natural law, can
be translated by the verb propagate, in order to grow the idea and the
thought, or by the verb renew, by physical and spiritual transformation.

# # Man and his vision of nature
Accustomed to immediate contact and material satisfaction, and analyzing the
things just by affecting the senses (touch, taste, smell, hearing, vision),
man "only sees an angle of nature and cannot judge him the harmony of the
set." The vision of the human being is very narrow in relation to the laws of
Nature. 

Only those who persevere in search of God's knowledge can
approach the immutable truths, discovering why things are.

## Reproduction of the population of the globe
They teach the Spirits (and is of knowledge even of the materialists) that the
reproduction of living beings is a natural law, because without it the tangible world
perishes. Even so, because we are faced with a (immutable) Law of God, the
population of the Earth will never become excessive, for nature itself
in charge of maintaining the necessary balance. 

According to Herculaneno Pires: 

> "In the proportion of population growth, science and the technique increase the
production and use possibilities of uninhabited regions." While
man destroys on one side, countless others study, research and work in the
the creation of processes for maintaining the well-being and progress of the
Humanity.

## Improvement of races
From the point of view of Spiritism, based on reincarnation (which is
inserted into the Law of Nature, by the sovereign Justice of God), although certainly
that human races, by a succession process, will disappear and give
place to other races, more perfected, the spirits of men are the same,
constantly improving new bodies. No one has any doubt that
civilized today "are descendants of crude and savage beings of the times
primitives." 

In question No 691, kardec's Book of Spirits shows that, although
the origin of the breeds is lost through the ages, they are part of the great
human family and thus whatever the ancestral trunk, they have always been able to
merge and form new types. 

From a physical point of view, in primitive races brute force prevailed, in
damage to the intellect.  Currently, also complying with a Natural Law (Law of
Progress), man does much more with intelligence than brute force.
"Ed, however, does a hundred times more, "prove the spiritsâ€”because he put the
their service forces of nature, which do not make animals."

## Man obstacles to reproduction
Whatever man does and that can prevent the march of nature, no doubt
revert to its own detriment. So even when man has to, by
example, extinguish a pest that affects the crop or destroy larvae that
human health, should do so with intelligence, not to unbalance
nature. This is wise: the eagle eats the snake; the snake eats the mouse; the mouse eats
the insect, etc., in a balanced way. 

Man must use his power for good. Therefore, the ecologists demonstrate
that the indiscriminate killing of certain animals poses risks to the life of the
Man.

## Reproduction, marriage, celibacy and polygamy
Marriage is a means of progress for man; without him, man would come back to life
Animal. Indissoluble marriage is man's law; their permanence occurs by the
union with love (which is Natural Law). Marriage is also a union for procreation,
for reproduction, for moral evolution. 

Celibacy (not marrying) contradicts the Natural Law; is only valid for God, as
meritorious sacrifice. Polygamy is a custom and does not come from instinct; flees the Law
Natural, because to man is given control: he has free will.
