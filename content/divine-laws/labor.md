We have already learned that the Law of Nature, or Natural Law, or Divine Law, or Law of
God, it is one that does not depend on man's will for his existence. Like this
the satisfactions of man's needs, whether gross or ignorant, are
intelligent or educated, poor or rich, are only accomplished by the work of
someone or nature itself. The moral greatness of the work is in each
living by his own manual or intellectual effort. Work is a Law
Natural, immutable, as God did.

## Work on both planes of life — material and spiritual
When, in Question 675, of The Spirits Book, one wonders whether we should
understand by work only the material occupations, the Spiritual Plan
replies, "No; the Spirit also works, like the body. Every useful occupation is
work." In this way, materially, both the fisherman works and the
or the aviator, or the driver, or the baker, or the farmer, or the
housewife (taking care of the home and preparing food for the family). However
on the spiritual level, behind every act of ourown, there is the work of the Spirits,
bringing light and inspiration. The large and small works of the intellect (which do not
physical raw material) — inventions, discoveries, great books that
have changed the course of history—are emanated from the Spirit, they are works carried out
in the sphere of spiritual action.

## Purpose of work imposed on man
The work being a requirement of nature, verifying that even the animals
work for their livelihood (conservation) and for the very
natural balance (to renew the species), we must learn that, for the
man "work is a consequence of his bodily nature: it serves as an atonement
of past debts, as well as for the conservation of his body, and also as
ways to improve intelligence, by learning, developing its
Thought. Even the one who possesses sufficient goods to live without "shedding the
sweat of his body, "no doubt has a moral duty to be useful to the similar and,
doing so, complies with the Natural Labor Act.

## Work limit and home need
They teach spirits who, also being part of the Law of Nature, "rest
serves to repair the forces of the body, and it is necessary to leave a little more
freedom to intelligence, which must rise above matter." Show
yet, the Spirit that "the limit of work is the limit of forces; No
Nevertheless, God gives freedom to man."

## Man exploitation by man at work
The weighted awareness of the spiritualized, more evolved human being, repels the
exploitation of man by man, by greed, selfishness, pleasure; Repels
excessive exploitation of animals, leading them to exhaustion. One learns from the
Spirits that is malevolonic action (contrary to the Law of God) that of man who has power
and therefore imposes excessive work on its inferiors.

## The work for a materialist and a church saint
According to Karl Marx, materialistic philosopher, man, with his work, his action
about nature, transforms this and also to himself. (It wouldn't have been inspired
by the Spirits?). For St. Augustine, great philosopher of the Church, Spirit of
high hierarchy, work develops in man, and once, the qualities of the
heart and intelligence.
