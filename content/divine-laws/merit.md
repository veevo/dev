Sendo criados por Deus, na simplicidade e na ignorância, mas com destino à
perfeição, sempre tivemos a estrada aberta à nossa frente esperando por nossa
vontade e esforço em trilhá-la na direção da felicidade, que nos aguarda mais
adiante.

We are today what we have done of us over time, but we are fully able to
be better if we wish, then within divine logic, each will receive
according to his works, in the faithful context of the law of merit.

Jesus also taught us the law of merit in his parables. In the parable of the rich
e Lazarus, quoted by Luke, 16:19-31, we find:

> Son, remember that you have received your possessions in your life, and Lazarus, only
evils; and now this is comforted, and you tormented. In addition, a
great gulf between you and us, so that those who wanted to pass from here to there
could not, nor could they pass here (Luke, 16:25-26)

It is the law of merit that is also present in this gospel passage. When
both disembodied, the rich who did not use well the goods that are
borrowed, ended up in a region of moral torments and via Lazarus in the regions
Heavenly.

It is important to remember that all the resources needed for our prosperity
have always been and at our full disposal. Use them with
more or less intensity has always been a deliberation exclusively ours,
within the free will of each.

Paul of Tarsus for example teaches us:
> "I'll never leave you, I won't help you." (Paul, Hebrews 13:5)

## The role of Spiritism
The Spiritist Doctrine offers us, without mysteries or rodeo, information
wonderful about the spiritual reality that awaits us.

It convinces us that peace is an achievement demanding inner change, before the
life and others; and leads us along gentle paths as we aviate the
recipes of peace contained in the Gospel.

It makes us aware that in the Universe it is watching the Law of Merit; that evolution is
long process, from which no one is excluded, nor will it be lost 'forever', for
more than it erre, and that it is up to each one to carry it out.

It reveals to us that the instrument for each Spirit to achieve perfection is the
reincarnation, which occurs infinitely times, as many as necessary. All
can be conquered as we strive to experience the lessons of
Jesus.

## Law of Merit - Emmanuel
Emmanuel in the book Divine Justice, leaves us this message concerning the law of the
Merit:

```
If you assume that God creates privileged beings to ignite greatness,
thinks of justice, before worship.

To do this, just remember the embarrassing circumstances in which they disembodied
almost all the great figures of science, religions and the arts, which
marked the ideas of the world, in the lines of emotion and intelligence.

Dante, exiled.
Leonardo da Vinci, semi-paralyzed.
Columbus, in disdevfood.
Ferno of Magellan, trucidado.
Galileo, mocked.
Behring, hungry.
Luther, persecuted.
Lavoisier, guillotine.
Beethoven, deaf.
Mozart, in extreme penury.
Braille, tuberculous.
Lincoln, murdered.
Gandhi, shot dead.

And the geniuses of the height of Hugo and Pasteur, Edison and Einstein, left the Earth
less painfully, it is necessary to recognize that they have passed, among men, also
suffering and fighting, along with the anvil of constant work.

Every consciousness is the daughter of the works themselves.

Each achievement is each other's service.

God has no prerogatives or exceptions.

All glory is priceless.

It's the law of merit that no one escapes.
```
