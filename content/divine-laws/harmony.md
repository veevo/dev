The law of harmony is a gift from God to his children. It's through
of it that everything is in balance in the universe. From the simple atom to
constellations around infinity.

With regard to this important law, Camille Flammarion in "God in nature"
brings us:

> The atmosphere is no longer only a mixture of gases; plants stop
be simple atomic aggregates of carbon or hydrogen; perfumes don't get
reduce the impalpable molecules and only spilled at night to safeguard the
fries; the embalmed breeze means something more than a simple
air current; clouds do not represent only aqueous vesicles of aqueous steam; the
Nature is not offered exclusively which chemistry laboratory, or
physics... (1048)

> We sense at all a law of sovereign harmony, which governs the march
simultaneous of all things, which surrounds the most intimate beings of a vigilance
instinctive, which jealously holds the treasure of life in the fullness of strength and
which, by its perpetual rejuvenation, unfolds in immutable power to
fruitfulness created. In all this nature there is a kind of universal beauty,
that our soul breathes and identifies, as if this ideal beauty belonged
only at the home of intelligence. (1049)

The superior spirits also mention this fundamental law in question 540 of
The Spirits' Book:

> " (...) That's how everything works, everything chains in nature, from the atom
primitive to the archangel, for he himself began with the atom. Admirable law of
harmony, that your limited Spirit cannot yet cover the whole!"

Kardec also mentions universal harmony in commentary on question 8
of the same book:

> The harmony in the mechanism of the Universe patent
combinations and designs determined and, therefore, reveals
intelligent power. Assigning primary training at random is
folly, for chance is blind and cannot produce the effects of
intelligence produces. A clever chance wouldn't be a chance anymore.

## Law of Harmony and Law of Progress
The law of harmony is also directly linked to the [law of the
progress](../progress). 

Kardec also mentions in the Spiritist Magazine of 1860, July, pg. 226, p. 2ยบ, item 8:

Progress is the law of nature. To this law all beings of creation, animated
and inanimate, were submitted by the goodness of God, who wants everything to be
and prospers. 

According to Allan Kardec "everything is chained in nature, from the primitive atom to
the archangel, for he himself began with the atom. Admirable law of harmony, of which
your limited spirit cannot yet cover the whole." (33)
