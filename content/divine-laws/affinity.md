There are laws that govern life, of which we do not yet have the understanding
Full. One of them is the law of affinity. People come together or come together for
affinity of trends, tastes, goals.

So that only go to a stadium those who like football, and that, in the
bars, we'll only find those who like to drink.

This is also the way with people. The affinity law brings them together in a given
region, considering the predominance of its characteristics. That way is that
we can clearly perceive the trends of some peoples, for violence, or
for peace, for example.

## Renaissance
Did you know it is through the law of affinity that the reincarnation spirit
boosts the egg and sperm containing the genetic load conducive to the
your experiences in the physical body?

Thus, if you have to develop cancer, for example, the egg will be penetrated
sperm with genetic information capable of forming a body
predisposed to illness.  That doesn't mean it's going to develop cancer, but
will have a body prone to this.

## Attraction for thoughts
It should be borne in mind that the spirit world is not in a distant region
of the world of the living, on the contrary, both interpenetrate. Thus, the Spirits
perceive us, just as some red perceive them through college
Psychic.

Governing these two worlds, there is the Law of Affinity or Harmony.

In this way, it is by the thoughts that we attract the disincarnated and are attracted
by them.

## Undue Attitudes
It is also important to remember that our undue attitudes also attract energies
Perverse. 

They narrate the superior Spirits that the reality of carnival, observed from beyond, is
very different and woefully sadder. Crowds of unhappy spirits
they also invade the avenues in a sad spectacle of great proportions.
Evildoers of darkness bind to revelers by the invisible threads of the
thought, because of the preferences they bring in the intimate world.

Harmony in the universe, like gravitation, is the law of life. You live in place and
with whom one wishes psychically. There is a vibratory exchange in all and in
All. And this harmony is given by the desires and tendencies cherished in intimacy
and not according to the outer packaging.

And it is thanks to the law of affinity that the spirits of darkness bind themselves to
careless revellers, inducing them to depressing and grotesque attitudes of
regrettable consequences.

Unhappy spirits take advantage of the wave of madness that takes over minds,
to carry out cruel vendettas planned long ago.

Macabre plots are architected in the beyond tomb and carried out in these days
in which momo reigns sovereign over the creatures that allow themselves to fall into the revelry.

Not even children are spared the sad spectacle when these revelers
of the shadows arise to celebrate momo.

How many crimes happen these days... how many accidents, how much madness...

## Inspirations
Did you know that many of the fantasies of grotesque expressions are inspired by the
spirits living in lower regions from beyond?

It is more common than thought, that men visit these places of despair and
madness during physical body sleep, through what we call dream.

While the body rests the spirit becomes semi-liberated and makes its incursions into the
world, always seeking the beings with which it is set by the vibrations
that broadcasts.

Thus, it is important that we seek to tune in with the higher spheres, where
benefactors living spirits that aim to help us overcome the difficult
journey in the physical body.
