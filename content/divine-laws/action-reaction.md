The Law of Action and Reaction is an important law that teaches us that everything good or
bad we do, will benefit us or harm us tomorrow.
[Jesus] (/about/jesus) taught us about this law when he said "to each one will be
according to his works." 

For example, a person who now kills someone may be murdered (in this or
in another life). Everything the person does is registered. So all that
sorrow in his favor shall be given to him as merit and what comes against him, him
will be charged.

This law also explains "unexplained" sufferings by society. For example,
a good person, charitable, dear by all, suddenly suffers an accident and passes
the rest of your days unused.

Would God be committing such injustice?

To the vision of other religions that do not accept reincarnation, yes. But not in the light of the
[Spiritism] (/spiritism). That good, charitable person could have been a
cruel killer in another life and would be thus rescuing his debt.

It is important to note that there is no escape or subterfuge in the face of
[god's laws] (/divine laws). However, a person can reduce their debt
through the practice of good and [charity](/virtues/charity).

## Book Quotes
We find the law of action and reaction (also known as [law of cause and
effect](../cause-effect) widely documented in [bibliography)
Spiritist](/books).

[J. Herculano Pires](/bio/herculaneum-pires), for example says:
> "Nothing happens by chance. It all is the result of the law of cause and effect. And every effect
has a meaning: that of evolution. We are all faulty spirits and suffer the
evidence we ask before we incarnate. We have collective debts to redeem. But
beyond the rescue awaits us freedom, peace, progress. Young people who
died were spared future suffering in a life in which the disease, the
old age and death are the salary of all of us." (J. Herculano Pires in Na Era do
Spirit, cap. 3.)

[Emmanuel] (/bio/emmanuel) also contributes several important definitions
diseases, family, etc.

### Diseases
"Congenital diseases are nothing more than reflections of the unfortunate position to which
we conducted ourselves in the near past, complaining about hospitalization in the sphere
physical, sometimes short-term, for the treatment of inner disharmony in which
we've been compromised. However, other changers arise from the reflections of the past in the
existence of the body, disguised guilt and hidden remorse. They are plantations
of certain time that the law of action and reaction governs, vigilant, with security and
accuracy." (Emmanuel, in Thought and Life, cap. 14.)

### Family
"Effectively, you love the adopted children with the same selflessness with which you
strives to build the happiness of the blood sprouts themselves. However
do not hide the reality of the situation itself so that you do not oppose the Law
of Cause and Effect which brought them back to your conviviality in order to olem the
passion imbalances that marked their conduct at another time."
(Emmanuel, in Astronauts from beyond, cap. 4.)

"The relative who settled you on the path by obstacle hardly
transpolevel... Bless him and help him as much as you can. The laws of cause and effect,
as far as affinity principles do not work without reason." (Emmanuel, in
Astronauts from beyond, captain. 24.)

### Universal Harmony
"On the other hand, the principles of cause and effect have their own
penalogy before Divine Justice. Each of us brings in you and with you the
results of the shares themselves. No one escapes the laws that ensure the harmony of the
Universe." (Emmanuel, in The Age of the Spirit, cap. 12.)
