## Concept of justice
(definition of ulpiano, Roman jurist): "is the constant and perpetual will to give
to each one what is his own." (definition of spirits, q. 875, l.e.): "justice is the
respect for the rights of each one." Justice is a natural feeling; god the
granted to man.

## Divine justice
(rule of natural law): wanting for others what one wants for himself
or do not wish for others what is not natural to wish for you.

## Divine justice in its fullness
(founded on spiritist sense): the fact of reincarnation, because the purpose of
of this, by the will of God, is to grant man, by being incarnate thinking, to
opportunity to atone with his previous life mistakes and to progress through his
effort itself. 

Thus, God, by his magnanimity, uses heavenly equity and love, and puts
in the balance of supreme justice the actions of men; impartially, it weighs the
obstacles each had in the previous life, voluntarily or unintentionally, and
grants them, one by one, the chance to redeem their debts, to repair their mistakes,
through trials of the new existence.

## Justice and right of ownership
assuming that everyone has the right to life, this being the first
natural rights, to bring together what he achieved and, without selfishness, defend his
honest property. 

The property fruit of work is a natural right. What abers god's law
and the very conscience of good men is the fact that, selfishly, the
accumulate possessions without useful destination or acquired to the detriment of others.
today, even under the law of men, property must have an allocation of
to better approach justice, preventing few from having much and
many have little.
