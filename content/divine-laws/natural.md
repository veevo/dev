The Natural or Divine Law stems from the essence of things; is perfect and immutable,
as emanation of nature; represents how that the materialization of the will of the
Supreme Creator â€” God. No man promulgates a Natural Law, for it exists
regardless of his will; he himself is also a product of this law. 

To better understand it, see:
the wind blows and cools the Earth; the Sun rises and brings warmth to beings and vegetables;
the rain goes and the rivers fill up, giving life to the fauna; plants grow and give
fruits; men and animals reproduce, fulfill their trajectory and die.
All this occurs, without a line being written by man, determining
so be it.

Everything that exists in the Universe has its origin in the Natural Laws: mineral, vegetable,
human beings, spirits, are harmonic components of the whole, governed by
by these laws. Thus, being man, also, integral to nature, is not
able to create a Natural Law. With all his decanted wisdom, his
scientific and philosophical knowledge, man is not able to create a grain of
corn even.

## Characteristics of Natural Law
The two essential characteristics of the Natural Law are:

* be ETERNAL (one cannot establish its beginning, for thus she would come
of nothing, nor can one determine its end, for it is infinite);

* be ImMUTABLE (not subjecting to changes, only once it is of
perennial stability). Only the Laws of the State or Laws of Men, by
imperfections of these, are imperfect and therefore modifiable. The Laws of God,
because they are harmonic as the Universe itself, they are eternal and immutable, invigorating
for everything and for everyone.

## Knowledge of the most important natural law
Although not everyone is up to understanding God's Law, as they teach
Spirits, "everyone will one day understand you through moral progress,
achieved in stocks." And there are always superior spirits teaching her, "The
God's law is written in conscience," and the most important thing is that of justice,
Love and Charity. Question 614 of The Spirits' Book says: "the Natural Law
is the Law of God; is the union necessary for man's happiness." 

Say what he should or should not do, and he only becomes unhappy when she
Away. 

It's in the consciousness book.
