Love is the basis of all the laws and gifts of God that God has given us. It's the strength
for all progress and the constant state of being for all
superior Spirits. 

They are the antithesis for the materialistic and instinctive vision of man universe, in
his ignorance, lives by. Selfless love was the message jesus brought to the
humanity and died on the cross to make sure that the lesson was never
Forgotten. 


## Love to others
is the greater foundation for spiritual elevation. Loving those who love us is very
Easy... Now, "love others like yourself" when it is a
enemy, it is necessary, in fact, a great soul greatness. But remember, "the
opponent you judge wicked maybe it's just a need for
understanding" (andr√© luiz, through chico xavier, green light)

## Loving others as a principle of superiority
we all find the animals below our condition, but how many of us in many
moments, don't they act animalesquemente? are not strength, weapons, money,
position, not even the culture or intellectual leather that make the upper man
before God; it is by the persevering mind in good, that the human being grows. Love when
close to himself as he is neither cowardice nor weakness; these come from pride,
Just. When we overcome pride, selfishness and prejudice, we come to the law of
Love.
