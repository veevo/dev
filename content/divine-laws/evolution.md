Law to which all spirits are subordinated. All spirits progress. Jesus, the most enlightened spirit he has ever incarnated on earth, was once an anthropophagous, a savage. Just as a murderer will come, more time less time, according to his progress, to be a spiritual conductor of a planet, an angel, an archangel and so on.

It is the law that makes clear the most divine justice, which many religions proclaim but contradict themselves in their teachings, and only spiritist doctrine in the light of reincarnation teachings clearly explains. There are no spirits created aside as they teach other religions. All are created of the same divine flame and all spirits are part of this cosmic whole. Taking this into account, it is lawful to say that we will all one day come to be Christs. Just as we were Aboriginal, anthropophages and more for the past, animals, vegetables, minerals...

According to the law of evolution that provides all spirits equal chances of progress. And they will all go invariablely progress.
(Basic reading: "The book of spirits" by Allan Kardec, "The Genesis" by Allan Kardec , "Evolution in two worlds" dictated by the spirit André Luiz and psychographed by mediums Francisco Cândido Xavier and Waldo Vieira and "What is spiritism"by Allan Kardec)
