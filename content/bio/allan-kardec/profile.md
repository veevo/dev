## Introduction
Today Spiritism has found a huge rebirth in the UK, Brazil, and America, with growing branches all 
over Europe and South America.

Since Rivail’s amazing work over 100 years ago countless books on every aspect of Spiritism and 
its relation to our daily lives have been dictated through mediums from [Spirit Teachers](/about/spiritual-guide). 
Yet none of these wonderful writings can ever come close to [Kardec’s 5 book codification](/spiritism/codification)
Even though he was not a medium, he never saw a [Spirit](/about/spirit), and these works were put to 
paper over a century ago, these 5 books continue to be the basis of Spiritism. Why?

## Why Rivail?
But why did the [Superior Spirits](/about/superior-spirit) choose Rivail? 
What did the Spirit Teachers know about him that made him the correct person to organise and publish 
the vast amount of information they wanted to share? 

The answer is: aptitude for sciences, philophy and education.

## Aptitude for sciences and philosophy
As a child he showed an aptitude for the sciences and philosophy and, at the age of ten, 
he was sent to the [Pestalozzi Institute](http://www.en.heinrich-pestalozzi.de/)
in [Yverdun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yverdon-les-Bains). 

This was the school of the influential Swiss educationalist [Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Heinrich_Pestalozzi), 
whose radically new methods of teaching were 
attracting pupils from well connected families all over Europe.

Rivail quickly proved himself to be a child genius of rare distinction. He was asked to teach 
his own classmates. He also became one of Pestallozi’s favourite pupils and most ardent disciples and left 
Yverdun with a degree in letters and science and a doctorate in medicine.

Rivail’s most significant achievement was to develop a systematic method of scrutinising 
mediumistic communications of a philosophical nature that resulted in a consistent body of 
teachings to suit all needs

His training as a scientist, and acute, rational mind allowed him to detach himself emotionaly 
and develop a way to verify that what was being communicated from the Spirit Teachers 
(through many mediums) was exactly what the Spirit Teachers were trying to communicate. 
This precession assured that the ideas expressed within the codification are consistent, 
clearly expressed and not influenced by the mediums or by Rivail himself.

## Belief in Education
Rivail came to believe that education was ‘the key to harmonizing the relations between 
rich and poor’. These factors must have played a major role in making the spirit teachings that 
Rivail would encounter later in his life appear so attractive to him. Not only would he be 
open minded enough not to reject them for religious reasons, but they would also appear to be 
confirmation of his egalitarian beliefs which ran counter to many of the Church’s dogmas.

## After Perstalozzi
After leaving the Pestalozzi Institute Rivail settled in Paris and in 1824 he published his 
first book. This was based on his own system for teaching mathematics and was reprinted until 
1876. The following year, at the age of 21, he opened his own ‘First Grade School’ and in 
1826 he opened another, ‘The Rivail Technical Institute’. 

He taught chemistry, physics, mathematics, astronomy, comparative anatomy and rhetoric, 
and also spoke nine languages - Italian and Spanish fluently. 

Rivail also submitted proposals for educational reform to the French Legislative Chamber 
which were highly praised although not adopted.

## A highly respected educator
By 1848, Rivail was a well known and highly respected educator who could have existed quite 
comfortably for the rest of his life by living on the proceeds of his books.

It is obvious that the Spirit Teachers also saw in Rivail a person who was already an established 
publisher of books on education, and adept at expressing complex ideas in ways that anyone could understand.

## Conclusion
In conclusion Rivail’s scientific mind allowed him to accurately filter through the mass amount of 
communications he sought out, while his ability to publish these ideas in a way that made them easy 
to understand made him the perfect candidate in the eyes of the Spirit Teachers. 

That these 5 books are still current today, and still the basis for Spiritism is testament to the 
genius that was Rivail: the scientist, the educator and publisher of school textbooks.
