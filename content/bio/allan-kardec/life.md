## Born
Hippolyte Léon Denizard Rivail, was born in Lyon, France , on October 3, 1804, of a traditional family, 
greatly distinguished in the legal profession and court system. Rivail did not pursue any of these careers. 
From his youth, he was inclined toward the studies of science and of philosophy.

## Education
Educated in the renown School of [Pestalozzi](../johann-pestalozzi), in 
[Yverdun ( Switzerland )](https://www.yverdon-les-bains.ch/), he became one of that celebrated 
teacher’s most eminent pupils and one of the most zealous propagandists of the Educational system that exercised a 
great influence in the reform of the Educational system in France and in Germany.

## Notable Intelligence
Endowed with a notable intelligence, he was drawn to teaching, due to his character and his special aptitudes. 
At fourteen, he had already started to teach what he had previously studied, to some of his schoolmates, 
who had assimilated less than him. It was at that school that the ideas originated, which would later 
categorize him in the class of the progressive and free-thinkers individuals of the day.

Although he had been born under the influence of the Catholic religion, he was educated in a Protestant country. 
The acts of intolerance that he witnessed under these circumstances, led him at an early age to conceive the 
idea of a religious reformation, in which he labored silently for many years with the ultimate aim of achieving 
the unification of the faiths. He lacked, however, the indispensable element for the solution to that immense problem.

## Return to France
As soon as he completed his studies, he returned to France. Being thoroughly knowledgeable in the German language, 
he translated into German a variety of works on education and on morals and, what is uniquely characteristic of him, 
the works of Fénelon that had seduced him in an intriguing way.

He was a member of several societies, one of which the Royal Academy of Arras, that, in the competition of 1831, 
awarded him notable recognition on the following subject: Which is a system of study more harmonious with the 
needs of the time?

From 1835 to 1840, he established, in his home, at [Sèvres street](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rue_de_S%C3%A8vres), 
free study courses on Chemistry, Physics, Anatomy, Astronomy, etc., an accomplishment worthy of commendation at 
any time, but, above all, at this time in which only a few illuminated minds dared to follow that path.

Always concerned with making the educational system more appealing and interesting, he invented the ingenious method 
of teaching to count and a mnemonic picture of the History of France, with the objective of fixating in the memory, 
the dates of major events and discoveries that illuminated each reign.

## Academic Works
Among his numerous works to foster education, we will mention the following: Proposed Plan for the Improvement of Public Instruction (1828); A practical and theoretical study of Arithmetic, according to the methods of Pestalozzi, for the use of teachers and mothers (1824); Classic French Grammar (1831); A Manual of the Examination for the titles of capacity; Rational solutions to the subjects and problems in Arithmetic and in Geometry (1846); Grammatical Catechism of the French Language (1848); Program for the regular courses of Chemistry, Physics, Astronomy, Physiology, which he taught in Lyceum Polimático; Normal dictations of the examinations of the Municipality and of Sorbonne, followed by Special Dictations regarding Orthographic Difficulties (1849), an accomplishment highly regarded at the time of its launching and from which new editions are still been published today.

It can be seen that even before Spiritism had popularized Allan Kardec through his Celtic pseudonym, he had already become well known, through the varied nature of his accomplishments in the educational system. His works always had the objective of illuminating the masses and of uniting them better to their respective families and countries.

## Spiritism
About the year 1855, the spotlight focused on the subject of the manifestations of the Spirits, and Allan Kardec became dedicated to persevering on the observations of that phenomenon, and cogitating mainly in deducing its philosophical consequences. He could see, at once, that these phenomena were the beginning of new natural laws: the ones that govern the relationships between the visible and the invisible world. He recognized, in the action of the invisible world, one of the forces of Nature, whose knowledge would throw light on the immense problems that until then had been considered insoluble, and he understood its reach, under the religious point of view.

His main works written on this subject are: [The Spirits’ Book](/books/spirits-book), [The Mediums’ Book](/books/mediums-book), 
[The Gospel according to Spiritism](/books/gospel-according-spiritism), [Heaven and Hell](/books/heaven-and-hell), 
[Genesis](/books/genesis), and [Revue Spirite](/books/revue-spirit), a monthly newspaper of psychological studies, that had begun on January 1st, 1858.

## His death
A tireless worker, always the first to take on a task and the last one to leave it, Allan Kardec succumbed on March 31st, 1869 . He was about to reduce his activities and to move to another place, due to the considerable extension of his multiple occupations. Several works which were about finished, or that were awaiting the opportunity to come to light, will one day demonstrate the extensive power of his concepts.

He died as he lived: working. He had suffered a heart ailment for many years that could only have been counteracted by means of intellectual rest and lessened physical activity. However, since he was consecrated to his work, he refused everything that could absorb one single minute of his time and deviate him from his favorite occupations. What happened to him occurs to all the souls that have a strong temper: “the sheet dulled the blade.”

His body became numb and could no longer perform the services intended by his Spirit, while his spirit remained, more and more active, more energetic, fertile, forever enlarging the circle of its activity.

In such an unequal fight, his physical body could not subsist eternally. An aneurism ended his life and Allan Kardec died instantaneously. That left one less individual on Earth; but, a great name took his place among those that had illuminated this century; a great Spirit had departed for the Infinite, where all of those souls who he had consoled and illuminated, were waiting impatiently for his return! Death, I was saying not too long ago, redoubled its blows in the illustrious arrays! Whom will it now come to set free?

He went, as so many others, to recover in Space, to seek new elements for the recuperation of his worn-out organism due to a life of incessant labors. He departed to be among those who would be the luminaries of the new generation, to return shortly thereafter with them to pursue and to conclude the task that he had left in dedicated hands.

## His Legacy
The individual is no longer here; but his soul, will remain with us forever. He will be a strong protector, an extra light, a tireless worker that the phalanges of Space have incorporated. As on Earth, without interfering with anyone, he will expound his opportune advices; he will lessen the premature zeal of the ardent ones; he will aid the sincere and the disinterested ones, and will stimulate the indecisive ones. He now clearly sees everything that he had foreseen! He is no longer subject to the uncertainties, nor to the frailties and he will share his convictions making us reach the goal with his finger, pointing the way for us, in that clear and precise language, that had consecrated him among the literary annals.

The man no longer exists, we said it; however, Allan Kardec is immortal and his memory, his works, and his Spirit will always be with those who stand strong and vigorously wave the flag that he always respected.

An extraordinary individuality set up the task. He was the guide and the secure port for everyone. On Earth, the work will outlive the worker. The believers won’t congregate around Allan Kardec; but rather, they will congregate around Spiritism, just as he had structured it, and with his advice and his influence, we will move forward, with firm steps, to the blissful phase promised to a regenerated Humanity.
