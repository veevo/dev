Born in Lyon, France on October 3, 1804, of a traditional family, greatly distinguished in 
the legal profession and court system, Allan Kardec (Hippolyte Léon Denizard Rivail) did not pursue these careers. 
From his youth, he was inclined toward the studies of science and of philosophy.

Educated in the renown School of [Pestalozzi](../johann-pestalozzi), in 
[Yverdun ( Switzerland )](https://www.yverdon-les-bains.ch/), he became one of that celebrated 
teacher’s most eminent pupils and one of the most zealous propagandists of the Educational system that exercised a 
great influence in the reform of the Educational system in France and in Germany.

While working on [Spiritism](/spiritism), Rivail adopted the pseudonim _Allan Kardec_ 
trough which he compiled [the 5 books that compose the Spiritist codification](/spiritism/codification).
