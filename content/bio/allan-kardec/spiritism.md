Even before Spiritism had popularized Allan Kardec through his Celtic pseudonym, he had already become well 
known, through the varied nature of his accomplishments in the educational system. 

His works always had the objective of illuminating the masses and of uniting them better to their respective families and countries.

## Spiritism
About the year 1855, the spotlight focused on the subject of the manifestations of the Spirits, and Allan Kardec 
became dedicated to persevering on the observations of that phenomenon, and cogitating mainly in deducing its 
philosophical consequences. 

He could see, at once, that these phenomena were the beginning of new natural laws: the ones that govern the 
relationships between the visible and the invisible world. He recognized, in the action of the invisible world, 
one of the forces of Nature, whose knowledge would throw light on the immense problems that until then had been 
considered insoluble, and he understood its reach, under the religious point of view.

## Spiritist Books
His main works written on this subject are:   

* [The Spirits’ Book](/books/spirits-book) concerning the philosophical part of the doctrine, and whose first edition appeared on April 18th, 1857;
* [The Mediums’ Book](/books/mediums-book) concerning the experimental and scientific aspect (January of 1861); 
* [The Gospel according to Spiritism](/books/gospel-according-spiritism) concerning moral and ethics (April of 1864); 
* [Heaven and Hell](/books/heaven-and-hell), or The Justice of God according to Spiritism (August of 1865); 
* [Genesis](/books/genesis) the Miracles and Predictions According to Spiritism (January of 1868); 
* [Revue Spirite](/books/revue-spirit) a monthly newspaper of psychological studies, that had begun on January 1st, 1858. 

## Spiritist Society of Paris
On April 1st, 1858 he founded the first Spiritist Society regularly constituted, under the denomination of 
“Parisian Society of Spiritist Studies,” whose deliberate objective was the study of whatever could contribute 
toward the fostering of this new science. Allan Kardec defended himself with total foundation, for having 
written something under the influence of preconceived or systematic ideas. 

As an individual with a cool calm nature, he observed the facts and from his observations deduced the laws that govern them. 
He was the first one to present the theory regarding such facts and to organize them into a doctrinal body, methodical and regular.

He demonstrated that the facts, which previously had erroneously been considered supernatural, were actually subject 
to the [universal laws](/divine-laws). He classified them under the phenomena of Nature, thereby eliminating the 
last refuge of the wonder and one of the elements of superstition.

During the first years of the introduction of the spiritist phenomena, they were considered more an object of curiosity than of serious meditation. The Spirits’ Book caused the subject to be considered under a totally different aspect. 

The [turning tables](/about/turning-tables) that had merely been a prelude were discarded, and people started 
to pay greater attention to the doctrine, that embraces all the subjects of interest for Humanity.

## The publication of the Spirits' Book
The date of the launching of The Spirits’ Book was the foundation of Spiritism, which until then, had only counted on scattered elements, without coordination, and whose reach most people could not understand. Starting from that moment, the doctrine attracted the attention of the serious-minded people and took a rapid development. In few years, those ideas overtook numerous followers in all social circles around the world. That unprecedented success took hold, without a doubt, due to the sympathy that such ideas inspired; but, it is also largely due to the clarity with which they were presented, which is one of the characteristics of Allan Kardec’s works.

Avoiding the abstract formulas of Metaphysics, he knew how to attract everyone’s to read about it without becoming tiresome, which was an essential condition to the dissemination of the idea. On all of the controversial points, his argument, of pure logic, does not leave room for dispute and it predisposes the conviction. The material proof that Spiritism presents of the existence of the soul and of a future life tends to destroy the materialistic and pantheistic ideas. 

## Principles
One of the most fertile principles of that doctrine is the plurality of the existences, already foreseen by a group of ancient and modern philosophers, and, during these last times, by João Reynaud, Carlos Fourier, Eugênio Sue and others. The plurality of existences, however, had been maintained in a state of hypothesis and of system, while Spiritism had demonstrated the reality and the proofs that in this principle, one of Humanity’s essential attributes resides. From the plurality of existences derived the explanation of all the apparent anomalies of human life, of all the intellectual, moral and social inequalities, allowing man to know whence he comes, where he is capable of going, why he is upon the earth, why he suffers temporarily, and can see, above all, the justice of God.

The innate ideas displayed in a present incarnation are explained by the knowledge previously acquired in prior lifetimes; also, the action of men of ancient times that are relived once again explains the progress of the individual and of Humanity; the sympathies and dislikes are naturally going to be a result of the experiences and the nature of relationships from previous incarnations. Those relationships, that reunite the great human family of all times, suggests as a base, the advanced principles of fraternity, of equality, of freedom and of universal solidarity, which are the very laws of Nature and not mere theory.

## Without Charity there is no Salvation
Instead of the postulate: “Without the Church there is no Salvation, which fosters separation and 
animosity between the different religious sects that have been responsible for so much bloodshed, 
Spiritism has as its emblem: Without Charity there is no Salvation, which enhances equality among men, 
tolerance, freedom of conscience and mutual benevolence in the eyes of God.

Instead of blind faith, which annuls free thinking, Spiritism says: Unshakable faith is only that which can meet reason face to face in every human epoch. In order to have faith a base is necessary; and, this base is the perfect intelligence of that which one believes. To be a believer is not enough; above all, it is imperative to comprehend. Blind faith is no longer a part of this century. It is in fact due to the dogma of blind faith that today we still have, such a great number of non-believers; as it tries to impose itself by annulling one of man’s most precious abilities, that of reasoning, and of free-will.
