The book Brazil Heart of the World, Homeland of the Gospel, by Humberto de Campos, 
through the psychography of Francisco Cândido Xavier, brings in beautiful text, 
the spiritual history of Brazil.

Ishmael, the same son of Abraham with the slave Agar, is considered the Angel of Brazil,
Spiritual Benefactor, worker of the hosts of Jesus, who at the request of Christ himself, 
encamped the task of the transfer of the Gospel Tree from Palestine to Brazil.

According to Carlos Campetti [1], the first reference on Ishmael is contained in the
genesiss book, of the Bible, in its chapter 16, which tells the story of Saraí,
abraham's wife, who because of age would be barren. Saraí then asked that
her slave Hagar conceived a son for her husband and was born Ishmael. Many
years later, Saraí unexpectedly also conceives a son, Isaac, which
leaves the relationship between the two troubled women. Saraí asked Abraham to
hagar and Ishmael from their conviviality, but man sympathizes, after all,
was his son. Therefore, Abraham will talk to God, who reassures him,
stating that Ishmael would be the leader of a great nation and that he could
send him out along with his mother without grieving. Ishmael, later it's
referred to as the origin of the Arab peoples.

Biblical Ishmael is regarded by Spiritist scholars on the subject as the same
described by The Humberto de Campos Spirit in the book "Brazil, Heart of the World,
Homeland of the Gospel." Today, with his own passage of time, Ishmael also spent
by the process of evolution, not having the same psychological and moral characters
millennia ago, that is, progressed, as is the natural destination of the spirit.
Humberto Campos reports that he is currently one of the most committed
workers of Christ, more aware of their role, who actually
began since his last incarnation on earth's plane.

In heart of the world, The Homeland of the Gospel [2], it is reported that Ishmael receives from the
Jesus himself the incubence, along with a pleiade of Spirits of escol,
to deploy the new Earth, establish good on our planet, guide the
society on the path of moral progress, through the establishment of definitive
of the Gospel, with Brazil as the focal point of spreading the message of the
Christ.

In the work, Humberto de Campos records that Ismael's specific mission to
Brazil, pointed out by Jesus, would be to implement in our country its Gospel and
spread it from here to the world. Ishmael, thus, was in the spiritual leadership of
our nation since the discovery, caring for the Brazilian people in all
events, even the most troubled (after all, we are still in a world of
evidence and atonement).

The very formation of our people, initially by the indigenous (who were the
simpler of heart) and then with Africans (those thirsty for justice
the expression of the humble and the afflicted) and Europeans (who brought the
advances in the field of science and other knowledge), even by ways
tortuous, would be an important step for the formation of the collective soul of our
people and the realization of the spiritual path planned for Brazil.

The arrival on Brazilian soil of homeopathic groups, groups of
spiritual phenomena (even before Hydesville), among others, was also a
work attributed to the efforts of Ishmael and his team, which ultimately culminated in the
with the rooting of the newly revealed Spiritist Doctrine in our lands. "God,
Christ and Charity" is the flag of Ishmael, which inspired many formations of
spiritist houses in the birthplace of Spiritism in homelandlands. Later
also inspired by Ishmael in 1884 is created the embryo of the current Federation
Brazilian Spiritist, with a great ideal of unification and peace.

Although our country is the largest contingent of spiritists, where the doctrine has
more important, this is not to say, however, that the only way in the implementation of the
of this greater good on the planet is the unique and exclusive mission of Spiritism.
Regardless of religion, creed or philosophy, all those who practice the
gospel teachings, which do good to others, who strive to
attenuate the pain of the other, to see the smile in the other, are making present in the
divine precepts, carried out in the teachings of Christ.

Ismael always invites everyone, in his communications, the real experience of
fraternity among spiritists, by ending violence among all people,
and that all unite and truly love each other as brothers and sisters.

> – Ishmael, send my heart that from now on you are the caretaker of heritage
immortals that make up the Land of The Cruise. Receive in your arms of
devoted worker of my seara, as I received it in my heart, obeying the
sacred inspirations of Our Father. It brings together the tireless phalanxs of infinity,
who cooperate in the sacrosanct ideals of my doctrine and now begins the
building the homeland of my teaching.
