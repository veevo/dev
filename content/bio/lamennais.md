Born into a bourgeois family on June 19, 1782, in Saint-Malo, France, he was a brilliant writer, becoming an influential and controversial figure in the history of the French Church. 

With his brother Jean, he conceived the idea of reviving Roman Catholicism as a key to social regeneration. They came to outline a reform program in his work, Reflections of the state of the Church..., in 1808. 

Five years later, at the height of the conflict between Napoleon and the Papacy, the brothers produced a defense of Ultramontanism (Doctrine and politics of French Catholics seeking inspiration in the Roman Curia, defending the Pope's absolute authority in matters of faith and discipline). This book earned Lamennais a conflict with the Emperor, causing his escape to England quickly in 1815. 

A year later, at the age of 34, Lamennais returns to Paris and is ordained a priest. Fluent writer, politician and philosopher, he struggled to combine liberal politics with Roman Catholicism after the French Revolution. Therefore, already in 1817 he published Essays on the indifference in matters of religion considered in his relations with the political and civil order, in addition to a translation of the Imitation of Jesus Christ. Rehearsal earned him immediate fame. 

In it, Lamennais argued about the need for religion, basing his appeals on the authority of tradition and the general reason of humanity, rather than the individualism of private judgment. Although he advocated Ultramontanism in the religious sphere, in his political beliefs, he was a liberal who advocated the separation of the State of the Church, freedom of conscience, education and the press.

After the July revolution in 1830, Lamennais, together with Henri Lacordaire (The Exponents of Xviii Coding) and Charles de Montalembert, as well as an enthusiastic group of writers of Liberal Roman Catholicism, founded the newspaper L'Avenir. In this daily newspaper, Lamennais defended the democratic principles, the separation of the Church of the State, creating embarrassments both for himself, both with the French ecclesiastical hierarchy and with the government of King Louis Felipe. 

Pope Gregory XVI disauthorized Lamennais' views at the Mirari Vos Encyclical in August 1831. From then on, Lamennais began to attack the Papacy and European monarchies, writing the famous poem "Words of a believer", condemned in the Papal Encyclical Singulari vos in July 1834. The result was the exclusion of Lamennais from the Church. 

Tirelessly, he devoted himself to the cause of the people, putting his pen in the service of republicanism and socialism. 
He wrote works such as The People's Book (1838), the chores of Rome and Outline of a Philosophy. 
He was sentenced to prison, but, as early as 1848, he was elected to the National Assembly, retiring in 1851. 

On the occasion of his death in Paris on February 27, 1854, not wishing to reconcile with the 
Church, he was buried in a grave of indigent. 

In the Spirit World, he did not remain idle, behalf, that in The Book of Spirits, in question number 1009, 
there is a message of his ploughing, illustrating the answer. In it, he reveals the traces of his faith, 
conking creatures to approach the good shepherd and the Creator Father, vigorously combating the belief 
of eternal punishments. 

In the message he signs in The Gospel according to Spiritism, cap. XI, item 15, 
it reveals itself to be compassionate, who calls on creatures to obey the voice of the heart, 
offering, if necessary, his own by the life of a evildoer.
