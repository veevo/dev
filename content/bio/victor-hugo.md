Victor Hugo was very aggravated by intelligence; genius poet, exquisite and
fruitful writer. He sustained, without fading, tremendous struggles for freedom,
facing the wrath of reactionaries of all time, of those who do not hesitate to
sacrifice the most sacred and noble things so that their interests are
unscathed.\r

Because he was too big, he ceased to be a French citizen to become a citizen of
the world, because, as it was said, his literary work, his words, in the
political field, his ideas and thoughts influenced and benefited the peoples of
the whole world! He himself felt, despite his ingrained love for the country of
his birth, which belonged to all the peoples who suffered and found himself
bristling from freedom of thought. Thus, it was up to him to work, to fight
infatigably so that the light of spiritual truth would reign in the souls of all
his brothers and sisters, be they of this or that homeland. And in order for
this light to shine, it was a sine qua non condition that men be awarded the
sacred right of freedom, freedom to feel God and his Justice, within the
intellectual possibilities of each one. This freedom, in short, which is an
essential condition of man.\r

This is why, in the middle of the Peace Congress in Lausanne, he said: I am a
citizen of every man who thinks!\r

It is not the intention, without a doubt, to describe the life and work of
Victor Hugo, life for too extensive, because in everything he was special,
whether as a poet, thinker, playwright, novelist, historian, panfletista,
speaker, journalist and spiritist.\r

He has always shown himself an uncompromising enemy of the death penalty: The
man's head of the people is full of useful principles... cultivate, decipher,
regai, enlighten, moralize, use that head and you will not have the need to cut
it!\r

It is the purpose, however, to describe about the personality of Victor Hugo, to
focus on him as a spiritist, even in a succinct way.\r

In 1852, in the face of his political attitudes, he found himself in the
contingency of taking refuge in Jersey, in the Marine-Terrace villa. Soon after
he called to himself the wife and children, to whom some friends gathered, and
among them Vacquerie and Juliet Drouet.\r

In September 1853, Mrs. De Girardin arrived in Jersey, leading the big news:
Spiritism.\r

At this point, follows the transcription, which enlates the subject referred to,
narrated by Raymond Escholier in his book entitled The Glorious Life of Victor
Hugo:\r

His religious beliefs, which to certain frivolous souls seem so simple, so
restricted, sometimes so extravagant, are the true heritage transmitted by their
rustic ancestors.\r To say, these ideas are older than Christianity: faith in
the survival and permanent presence of the dead, in the power of sortilegio and
magic. Hugo is not limited to introducing into French poetry the expressions of
the people, the popular language, so full of images, so colorful, so expressive;
he also gave the right of citizenship to the beliefs of primitive man, who
always existed in the old soil of France.\r

To find the one in France, the one victor hugo sang his painful mother to,
consulted him with his old friend, Mrs. Girardin; interrogating, through the
talking tables, the tomb covered with herbs and shadows. With Mrs. Hugo, with
Carlos, a wonderful medium, with Augusto Vacquerie and General Le Flô, Victor
believes penetrating the secret of obscure forces.\r

The first Spirit that presented itself at Marine-Terrace was leopoldina's.\r −
Where are you? − asks the poet.  \r Light.  \r − What do i have to do to meet
you?  \r Love.  \r So in the little house, so sad, everyone cried, everyone
believed it.  \r

In the revelations of the tables, Hugo sees the dazzling confirmation of his
religious ideas. And it is in this conviction that he writes, on September 19,
1854:\r

> − I have a serious question to ask. Beings, who populate the Invisible and who
> read our thoughts, know that for twenty-five years I have taken care of the
> subjects that the table raises and deepens. More than once the table has told
> me about this work; the Shadow of the Tomb urged me to finish it. In this
> work, evidently known in the beyond, in this twenty-five-year work, he had
> found, only by meditation, many results that make up today the revelation of
> the table; some of these sublime results becomes distinctly confirmed;
> intervira others who lived in my spirit in a confused state of embryo. The
> mysterious and great beings who listen to me see, when they want, in my
> thought, how you see it in a cave with an archote; know my conscience and know
> how much everything I have just said is rigorously accurate, that I was for
> moments contradicted, in my wretched human self-esteem, by the current
> revelation, which came to cast around my little lamp of miner the flash of a
> ray or a meteor. Today, everything I turn around is confirmed by the table:
> and the half revelations the table completes them. In this state of soul I
> wrote: 'The being called Shadow of the Tomb counseled me to finish the work
> begun; the being called Idea went further and 'ordered me' to make verses
> attracting piety to captive and punished beings, who make up what seems to the
> non-seers the dead Nature; Obeyed. I did verses that Ideia imposed on me.'\r

On May 22, 1885, he defaced the Spirit of Victor Hugo. Here are his last wills
entrusted in a will entrusted to Augusto Vacquerie:\r

> I leave 50, 000 francs to the poor. I wish you'd take me to the cemetery on
> the poor man's trailer. I refuse the prayers of all the churches. I believe in
> God.\r
