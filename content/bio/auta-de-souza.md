He was born in Macaíba, then Arraial, then city of Rio Grande do Norte, on September 12, 1876. 
She was skinny, quiet, light-skinned, a sweet brunette in sight like velvet to touch. 
She was the daughter of Eloi Castriciano de Souza, disembodied at the age of 38, and 
Dona Henriqueta Rodrigues de Souza, disembodied at the age of 27, both tuberculous. 

Before she turned 3, she became an orphan of a mother and, at the age of four, as a father. 
Their existence was marked by acerbos sufferings. Very early she met the orphanhood and still a 
girl, at the age of ten, watched the death of her beloved brother Irineu Leão Rodrigues de Souza, 
victimized by the fire produced by the explosion of a kerosene lamp, on the night of February 16, 1887.  

Auta de Souza and her four brothers were raised in Recife, in the old sobrado do Arraial, in the large farm, by her maternal grandmother, Dona Silvina Maria da Conceição de Paula Rodrigues, commonly called Dindinha, and her husband Francisco de Paula Rodrigues, who defaced when Auta was 6 years old.

Before the age of 12, she was enrolled at Colégio São Vicente de Paulo, in the Resort neighborhood, where she received affectionate welcome from french religious who directed him and offered him exquisite education: literature, English, music, drawing and learning the also dominate the French, which allowed him to read in the original: Lamartine, Victor Hugo, Chateubriand, Fénelon.

From 1888 to 1890, the young Auta studies, recites, verseja, helps the sisters of the College, enhances the beauty of her faith, in constant reading of the Gospel.

At the age of 14, still at the Educandary Resort in 1890, the first symptoms of the illness that robbed him, in full youth, the road and was the cause of his death, which occurred in the early hours of February 7, 1901, Thursday, at an hour and fifteen minutes , in the city of Natal, exactly 24 years, 4 months and 26 days old. The doctors could do nothing and Dindinha returned with everyone to Rio Grande do Norte. Auta was buried in the cemetery of Rosemary and, in 1906, her remains were transferred to the family's deposit, in the Church of Our Lady of Conception in Macaíba, his homeland.

The strong religious feeling and even the disease did not prevent them from having an absolutely normal life in society.

He was Catholic, but not submissive to the clergy. She didn't jump, she didn't fast and never got cloistered. It was communicative, cheerful, social. Her religiosity was deep, sincere, medullary, but not ascetic, mortifying, mystical. Her love for Jesus Christ, the Guardian Angel, did not distance her from all the dreams of maidens: love, home, maternal mission. At the age of 16, revealing his unusual poetic talent, he was a member of the young Public Prosecutor of Macaíba, João Leopoldo da Silva Loureiro, lasting only a year and a few months. Ended with acute sensitivity and burning imagination, she dedicated deep love to her boyfriend, but tuberculosis progressed and her brothers convinced her to resign. The separation was cruel, but only for Auta. The D.A. did not show the slightest reaction. It is true that I liked to hear her at the home parties to decry with her beautiful voice enveludada and with her dance gangs, polkas and waltzes, but was not the man indicated to love a soul as delicate and dreamy as Auta de Souza. He lacked spiritual refinement to realize the feeling that drew through the sweet eyes of the great poet.

This succession of painful blows deeply marked his soul of woman, characterized by crystalclear purity, a burning faith and a deep sense of compassion for the humble, whose misery both moved her. He was seen reading to the poor children, to humble women of the people or old slaves, the simple and naïve pages of the history of Charlemagne, brochure that ran the serts, written to the popular taste of the time.

The orphanhood of the poet, as a child, the tragic desencarne of her brother, the contagious disease and frustration in love, these four factors amalgamated to the strong religiosity of Auta, led her to compose a singular poetic work in the history of Literature Brazilian: Horto, his only book, is a song of pain, but also of Christian faith. The first edition of Horto came out of the prelo on June 20, 1900.

The suffering came to circumvent his innate sensitivity, which overflowed into moving verses and suits, sometimes burning, sometimes sad, ploughed into the shadow of the disease, in the bleak setting of the hinterland of his land.

On November 14, 1936, there was the installation of the Academia Norte-Rio Grandense de Letras, with the armchair XX, dedicated to Auta de Souza.

Free of the body, totally worn by the disease, Auta de Souza, radiating light of her own, lucid and glorious alçou flight towards the Greater Spirituality. But the compassion she had always felt for the sufferers caused the poet, in the company of other charitable spirits, to constantly visit the earth's crust. It was through Chico Xavier, that she, for the first time, revealed her identity, transmitting her poetry enfeixadas in 1932, in the first edition of parnaso de Além Tumba, released by the Brazilian Spiritist Federation.

In his physical existence, Auta de Souza was the captive bird who sang his desire for freedom; the resigned heart, which sought in Christ the consolation of the beatitudes promised to the afflicted of the earth. Beyond the tomb, it is the freed and happy bird that, made to the nest of ancient misfortunes, brings to men the message of goodness and hope, the appeal to faith and charity, indicating the right direction for the conquest of true life.

The Auta de Souza Fraternity Campaign, conceived by the companion Nympho de Paula Corrêa and approved, on February 3, 1953, by the Department of Social Assistance, of the Spiritist Federation of the State of São Paulo, then directed by the late confrere José Gonçalves Pereira, is a beautiful tribute to our dear Poetisa, Auta de Souza.
