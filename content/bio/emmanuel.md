Emmanuel is the name given by Brazilian spiritist medium Chico Xavier to the spirit 
to which he attributes the authorship of much of his psychographed works. This spirit 
was pointed out by Chico Xavier as his spiritual advisor.

There is also a book of the same name by Chico Xavier that bears the signature of Emmanuel, 
published in 1938.

## Mediumistic Work
The mediumistic work attributed to Emmanuel is composed of dozens of books, many of 
them translated into various languages. They are historical novels, books of spiritual 
counseling, works of biblical exegesis, etc.

Dear Friends, it is with great joy that we offer a table with the reincarnations of Emmanuel, described throughout the book Chico, Dialogues and Memories. The trajectory of this Benefactor, alongside Chico, who works incessantly for our evolution, greatly inspires us and motivates us to also seek to fulfill our duties as disciples of Christ. Every step in time, raising divine light and covering our multitude of sins, we will reach the Father! Lots of peace!!

"Emmanuel, exactly like this, with two "m" is spelled the name of the spirit, in the French original "L' Évangile Selon le Spiritisme", in a message dated from Paris in 1861 and inserted in the cap. XI, item 11 of the aforementioned work, entitled "The Selfishness".

The name was best known among Brazilian spiritists for the psychography of the mining medium Francisco Cândido Xavier. According to him, it was in 1931 that, for the first time, in one of the usual meetings of the Spiritist Center, the kind Spirit Emmanuel was present.

Describes Chico: 

> "I saw the physiopathic traits of elderly man, feeling my soul involved in the softness of his presence, but what impressed me most was that the generous entity was visible to me, within luminous reflexes that were shaped like a cross."

Invited to identify himself, he presented some traces of his previous lives, claiming to have been a Roman senator, descended from the proud "gens Cornelia" and also a priest, having lived even in Brazil.

From 24 October 1938 to February 9, 1939, Emmanuel conveyed to the mining medium his impressions, making us known the proud Roman patrician Lentulus Cornelius, in past life Públio Lentulus Sura, and which culminated in the extraordinary novel: Two thousand years ago.

Publius is the proud man, but also noble. Rome is his world and for him battle. He has not admitted corruption, showing since then his healthy character. Uncompromisingly, he suffers for years the suspicion of being betrayed by the wife he loves. For her, in the years of youth, she composed the most beautiful verses: "Soul mate of mylma / Flower of light of my life / Sublime fallen star / Of the beauties of the vastness..." and later: "You are my infinite treasure/ I swear to you eternal covenant/ Because I am your hope/ How are you all my love!"

You have the opportunity to meet Jesus personally, but between the option of being a servant of Jesus or the servant of the world, choose the second.

It is not for another reason that he writes, at the beginning of the aforementioned mediumistic work: "For me these memories have been very soft, but also very bitter. Soft for the remeration of friendly but deeply painful memories, considering my heart empedernido, who could not enjoy the radioid minute that had sounded on the clock of my spiritist life, two thousand years ago."

He defaced in Pompeii in the year 79, victim of the lavas of the Volcano Vesuvius, blind and already returned to the principles of Jesus.

Fifty years later, in the year 131, i'll be back on the world stage. Born in Ephesus, of Jewish origin, he was enslaved by illustrious Romans who led him to the ancient country of his ascendants. In his presumed 45 years, Nestorio shows in the Israeli size, a silent and unconformed pride. Separated from his son, who had also been enslaved, would again find him during a preaching in the catacombs where he, Nestorius, had the responsibility of the word. Christian since childhood, he is imprisoned and, after a period in prison, for remaining faithful to Jesus, is condemned to death.

Along with his son, Cyrus, and another twenty Christians, in an evening, he was led to the center of the arena of the famous Roman circus, situated between the hills of Célio and Aventino, in the capital of the Empire. Tied to a pole by thick strings fastened by brass links, skeletal, armed only with a thong that covered his waist, up to his kidneys, had his body stuck with poisoned arrows. With others, before martyrdom, he sings, directing his eyes to Heaven and, in the spirit world, is received by his love, Livia.

By year 217, pilgrim on Earth again. Young man, we can find him in the robes of Quinto Varro, Roman patrician, passionate cultor of the ideals of freedom.

Afervorado to Jesus, he feels to confrour his soul the ignorance and misery with which the privileged classes of Rome kept the multitude.

The thought of Christ, he feels, hangs above the earth and, however lute the Roman aristocracy, Varro does not ignore that a new world formed on the ruins of the old man.

Victim of a conspiracy to kill him during a sea voyage takes the identity of an old preacher from Lyon, named Corvino. He becomes Brother Corvino the young man, and becomes a gardener. Condemned to beheading, he has his execution sustained after the third coup, being granted slow death in prison.

Eleven years later, he reborn and takes the name of Quinto Celso. Since meninice, begun in the art of reading, it has been a prodigy of memory and discernment.

Frankly Christian, he suffered martyrdom in the circus, tied to a pole greased with resinous substance to which fire is fired. He was a teenager about 14 years old.

His final reincarnation took place on October 18, 1517 in Sanfins, Entre-Douro-e-Minho, in 
Portugal, with the name manoel da Nóbrega, at the time of the reign of D. Manoel I, venturoso.

Privileged intelligence, joined the University of Salamanca, Spain, at the age of 17. At 
21, he is at the University's Canon's College, where he attends canon law and philosophy classes, 
receiving the doctoral láurea on June 14, 1541.

Coming to Brazil, he was the one who studied and chose the place for the founding of the 
city of São Paulo, on January 25, 1554. The date chosen, considered as the day of conversion of the 
Apostle Paul, is intended to be a tribute of the university Manoel da Nóbrega to the university Paulo de Tarso.

The São Paulo historian Tito Lívio Ferreira, ends his work "Nóbrega and Anchieta in São Paulo de 
Piratininga" describing: 

> "Padre Manoel da Nóbrega founded the College of Rio de Janeiro. He drives it with the usual enthusiasm. 

On October 16, 1570, he visits friends and main residents. He says goodbye to everyone, because he is, 
he says, leaving for his homeland. Friends are surprised by his gestures. They ask him where he's going. 
He points to heaven.

The next day, you don't get up. Get the Extreme Anointing. On the morning of October 18, 1570, 
on the very day of his birthday, when he was 53 years old, with 21 years uninterrupted services to 
Brazil, whose foundations built, the founder of São Paulo dies.

And manoel da Nóbrega's last words are: 
> "I thank you, my God, My Fortress, My Refuge, which you have marked beforehand this day 
for my death, and you gave me perseverance in my religion until this hour."

And he died without knowing that he had been appointed, for the second time, 
Provincial of the Society of Jesus in Brazil: the land of his life, passion and death.

As a curiosity, we found records that Mr Freitas Nobre, already disembodied today, declared, on a 
TV show tupi de São Paulo), on the night of July 27 to 28, 1971, that when writing a book about 
Anchieta, had the opportunity to find and photograph a signature of Manuel da Nóbrega, as E. Manuel.

Thus, the initial E of the name of francisco Cândido Xavier's mentor was due to Ermano's 
abbreviation, which, according to him, would authorize the name to be spelled Emanuel, 
an "m" only and pronounced with oxytone accentuation. 

## The portrait of Emmanuel 
A portrait of the Spirit Emmanuel was made by the painter Delpino Filho. Chico Xavier reported that the spirit did not "pose" for the painter. In fact, the artist was assisted by a disembodied painter, who was friends with Emmanuel. The medium stated that the portrait produced is faithful to the benefactor, when in the personality of Roman Senator Publius Lentulus Cornelius. The only detail that could be corrected in the picture refers to the lips, which are actually narrower and male. The original painting is located at the headquarters of the Luiz Gonzaga Spiritist Group in Pedro Leopoldo, in a prayer room, made in the room where Chico was born in 1910.
