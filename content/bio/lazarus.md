Lazarus is the Greek form of the Hebrew abbreviation woolzãr _ Eleazar – "God helps".

It is presented as marta and maria's brother, all living in Bethany,
about an hour from Jerusalem. It was a simple village, surrounded "by
fields of barley, small groves of olivedos and fig trees"(1), in the
way from Jerusalem to Jericho.

The village was a contrast to judea's roughness, by the verdor it was clothed in.
The slopes were full of foliage, the white houses showed their porches
flowered and fineflowers adorned the carpet of green grass.

Lazarus, like his sisters, loved Jesus and said it openly. Jesus was like a
family member and always received with joy. When the Master finds himself
nearby, it is there, in the laughing and frank house that is received at the door
by his friend, with effusive embrace and the osculum on his face.

In Bethany there was Jesus a second family, in the nest of affections that
offer friends. The devoted friend, Lazarus, was there. It was the only place where
Galileo could enjoy a few hours of quiet, family intimacy _ was
like you're home. Lazarus is Jesus' great and devoted friend.

It is in Bethany, when the Rabbi narrates to his friend the latest events and explains
about the future, as the night progresses, which took place the famous episode in which
Jesus emphasizes the choice of the best part, as Luke narrates in his
Gospel, cap. 10:38-42.

When Lazarus fell ill, in shebat (February), Jesus was
preaching in Perea and the sisters sent him a messenger. It was two days of
march and the message was brief: "Lord, bebethat is sick he who loves."

The prophet of Nazareth settles him, saying goodbye to him with the certainty that that
sickness would not lead to death, but it was for the glory of God. Past two
days, Jesus undertakes the journey back to Bethany, therefore, upon reaching the
his fate Lazarus was 4 days old, for he had died on the same date
in which the messenger of Martha and Mary had conveyed to Jesus the message.

Because it was a distinct and esteemed family, there were many visits in the farm of
Bethany, when the news of Jesus' presence precedes Him. Marta goes to His
meeting and at the crossroads, on the edge of the village, sighting him, speaks to him: 
"Lord, if you were here, my brother would not have died." It looks like a complaint and a
veiled request, which is of slight hope.

Not far from there was lazarus tomb on a hillside cliff. Access is
gave by narrow rustic staircase and a dark underground gallery, with a block
stone, shaped like a grind, covering the mouth of the tomb.

Jesus asks Martha to call her sister and, accompanied by all the Jews
who were in the house at that time and followed Mary, the Master heads to the site
where the friend's body was closed.

Narrates the evangelist Jesus cried. Although the Jews commented that
that was the demonstration of how much rabbi loved Lazarus, His tears
felt and sincere were due to the finding of ignorance that men
were still carriers and consequently, many would be the pains that the
avassalariam for a long time empos.

In charge of Jesus, Martha has the tomb opened. A pestific breath spreads
around the neighborhood. Wrapped in wide embalmed bands of rare essences, the
face covered with a shroud, there's the corpse.

Now the Master to the Father and then shout in a vibrant voice: "Lazarus, come out."

Something white moves on the dark background of the catacomb. The ones are coming.
contours seem sharper. Walk slowly and, curled from the head to the
feet in the tracks of the embalming, Lazarus replies to Jesus, "Behold,
Sir!"

And when the night was made, Lazarus is again the good host, walking,
smiling, eating from the bread everyone ate. It was the reason for all the joys.
At the same time a motive for terror.

For those people, he became a riddle. What would be your memories
those four days when you were in death valley? But no one dared him
ask the adventures of the mysterious journey.

By the ignorance of lethargy, in the weeks that followed, almost not
spoke of something else in and around Jerusalem. Jesus doesn't even touch the corpse.
He had just ordered and Lazarus was now in their midst, in perfect health. Many
they sought him out and he became the target of general curiosity. After seeing the
Lazarus, the curious would come to Jesus, contemplating with a mixture of admiration and
fear that man of Nazareth, who gave orders to his own death, and death To Him
Obeyed.

When, a week before His death on the cross, Jesus returns to Bethany, they narrate
John, Mark and Matthew that the locality swarmed with pilgrims, because of the
coming Jewish Easter celebrations.

Jesus was invited to dinner at the house of a Simon, called leper. Maybe
one of those he had healed at some point in His journey of light through the earth.

Lazarus was invited, of course, to take place at the feast table.
Such a distinguished character could not miss. However, as long as the Friend
Celeste brought him back to physical life, awakening him from lethargic sleep,
Lazarus is no longer the same. Everything around you, the laughing landscape, the house
comfortable, the delight of life, everything has become an unimportant thing.

Lazarus had understood Jesus' message. Men fear him because they realize that the
blood palpitates in his veins, his body is warm, his eyes shine, his
lips smile. He returned "on the other side", but within him life sings "like
slatin in the colorful landscape and wing of birds." (3)

In Lazarus there is an intense joy because it recognizes the truth in the words of
Jesus: "I am the resurrection and the life; who believes in me will live, even if it has
died; and who in life believes in me will not die eternally."

And Bethany's friend is willing to work with Jesus in the procession of spirits
of the Spirit of Truth team. Its pages, affability and sweetness,
Obedience and resignation, The Law of Love, Duty Meet in The Gospel
according to spiritism, in Chapter IX, items 6 and 8, chapter XI, item 8 and in that of
number XVII, item 7, dictated all from 1861 to 1863 in Paris.

Lazarus is revealed as the one who loved Jesus very much, electing Him to the condition
of friend and following Him, as a Guide and Model, when he states: "Love
summarizes the whole jesus doctrine, since this is the feeling for
excellence..."

> "... The law of love replaces personality with the fusion of beings; extinguish e.t.
social miseries... When Jesus uttered the divine word _ love, peoples
they stood out and the martyrs, drunks of hope, descended on the circus."

(The gospel according to spiritism, cap. XI, item 8)
