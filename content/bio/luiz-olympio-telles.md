He was one of the greatest Brazilian journalists. It is considered as one of the pioneers
Spiritism in Brazil.

He was a primary professor, stenographer, official of the Legislative Assembly and
Official of the Public Library of Bahia. The English, French, the
Castilian and Latin. Collaborated in the following journals: "Diário da Bahia",
"Jornal da Bahia", "A Época Literária" (where he joined as a writer in 1849,
later passed on to its director) and author of the novel The Two Rivals.
In Salvador, he was one of the founders of the Dramatic Conservatory of Bahia (August
1857), in which personalities such as Rui Barbosa participated, among others.
In this Group Telles de Menezes caught contact with spiritist phenomena, coming
to correspond with French spiritists. It would later become
honorary partner of the Magnetic Society of Italy, as well as to join several
Spiritist and spiritualist societies of Europe at the time. It corresponded with the
Professor Hippolyte Léon Denizard Rivail and his secretary. 

He founded on September 17, 1865 in Salvador, the Family Group of Spiritism,
first doctrinal association in Brazil.

On that date, during the first meeting of the Group that began at 8:30 p.m., a
spirit that called itself "Angel of God" ("Angel Brazil", according to other
authors, and which some associate with "Ishmael" itself, sent psychographically
a message, the content of which greatly sensitive those present. (See just below)
Spiritual message:

> My son must today only worry about the sublime mystery of redemption;
because it was this incomprehensible sacrifice, which opened to humanity the way of
Bliss, that sin had closed; because until the day, in which
this astonished sacrifice was consumed, the good Spirits, who had already left
the earthly incarnations, where they had purified themselves, did not enjoy the light, only
enjoyed the peace of the soul and spirit, but of wrapped with the unclean Spirits
in the outer darkness.

> This act of God's infinite Mercy was so amazing in the world that
inhabitants, as in the world of spirits, because since then salvation has been
promised to all spirits as impure as they were, if
repent, and prove this repentance, practicing good only by
love of God and His Mother the BLESSED VIRGIN, and suffering the evils of life
body with resignation and patience, which through prayer would always reach
of GOD; and this resignation and patience are always increased in the reason of faith,
with which God is prayed and the precepts of his most holy Law are fulfilled.

> My son be sure to always pray to GOD, thus giving proof of your faith and
your goodwill, and GOD will fill you with your graces.

Goodbye, my son.
Angel of God
Bahia: 1867 - April 19

The following year (1866) published the opubsculus "Spiritism - Introduction to the
Study of the Spiritist Doctrine" (according to others, Spiritualist Philosophy), a
selection of excerpts he translated from The Book of Spirits by Allan Kardec.
Luiz Olympio Telles de Menezes also holds the title of pioneer of
spiritist press in Brazil.

On March 8, 1869 he announced, through a speech given at the Grêmio dos
Espiticos Studies of Bahia, the future appearance of the newspaper O Écho
D'Além-Tumba - Spiritism Monitor in Brazil.

In July 1869 Luiz Olympio Telles de Menezes launched the first newspaper
Spiritist of Brazil - O Écho D'Além-Tumba.

In the first spiritist journal in the country he called on spiritists.
"To us, who are gathered today, constituting, of course, the Guild of
Spiric Studies in Bahia, and to whom a certain vocation of alto committed the
commitment of this arduous mission, arduous and even thorny, yes, but radiating from good
hopes, it is up to us, by the means that it is necessary to be employed,
spread this regenerative and Christian belief, causing it to arrive indistinctly the
all men; and the material medium that Providence wisely offers us
to quickly bring the word of truth to the intelligence and heart of
all men, it's the Press."

The journal, printed on the typography of diário da Bahia, had 56 pages
and even circulated abroad - in London, Madrid, New York and Paris.
Soon the reaction of the Catholic Church was felt, which began to preach about
of the harms of the new doctrine, having launched a Pastoral Charter, dated
June 16, but only released on July 25, 1867.

This Letter, in the form of an opubic, with the title "Pernicious errors of the
Spiritism," Spiritism violently accused Spiritism, resorting to untruths.
(2) In this Capital a short book was published with the title – Philosophy
Spiritualist - Spiritism, whose pernicious doctrines, against all
expectation, has taken an increase, putting into practice certain superstitions
dangerous and failed, which are in the public field; and in the interest of
your salvation, dear children, we believe it is appropriate to address this Charter to you
to prevent you from the main mistakes, which contains this small
book, and against the superstitions that according to the doctrines contained therein are
practicing, as if he has informed us, and what is no longer possible to doubt.
Telles de Meneses, to refute her, wrote an open letter, of which he published
two editions in the same year, to the Archbishop of Bahia and Primaz do Brasil, D. Manoel
Joaquim da Silveira, where he says:

(1) "Spiritism must pass through rude trials, and in them God will recognize his
courage, its firmness and perseverance. Those who are absent by a simple
fear, or by a disappointment, resemble soldiers who are only brave
in peacetime, but that, at first shot, abandon their weapons."
It is believed that this letter was constituted in the first spiritist work of
Brazilian author, published in Brazil. The most lit point being the question of
reincarnation, the controversy came to end after a long time, when the
Father Julian José de Miranda, knowing that Telles de Meneses was Catholic of
birth, gave it closed stating that "Spiritism and Catholicism are the
same Church of our Lord Jesus Christ."
Telles de Menezes makes a point of reaffirming on father Juliano's response
José de Miranda.

(2) Spiritism and Catholicism are the same Church as our Lord Jesus
Christ; only times and words are changed; Spiritism is the
faithful translator, by God's envoys, of the Doctrines of the Gospel; and being God
United in substance and Trino in people, all men, both Spiritists or not,
it also only has one true Church, the Catholic Church; that in the first
times had been pursued by unbelief, as today is spiritism.
Luiz Olympio Telles de Menezes was the first president of the Spiritist Association
Brazilian Company, an entity aimed at "the moral and intellectual development of the
man in the broad bases that creates the spiric philosophy, and the exemplifying of the
sublime and heavenly precept of Christian charity."

Considering his mission accomplished in Bahia, Telles de Menezes transferred
for Rio de Janeiro, coming to work in the tachygraphic corporation of the Senate
empire, where he provided relevant services. In 1885, the Manual published the
brasiliense stenography, also leaving other unpublished works.
He died in extreme poverty, in his residence on Barão de São Félix Street,
buried in the Cemetery São Francisco Xavier at the expense of colleagues and friends.

As a pioneer of Spiritism in Brazil, Telles de Meneses was honored, for
proposal of the Brazilian Spiritist Federation to the then Post Office and
Telegraphs, which authorised the use of a postmark on 17
September 1965 – commemorating a century of the founding of the Family Group of the
Spiritism that was applied in the cities of Salvador and Rio de Janeiro.
