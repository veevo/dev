Mirabelli was born on January 2, 1889, in Botucatu, São Paulo. Famous for its mediumship, 
he was the son of Italian immigrants. Very young still, transferred residence to the 
capital of São Paulo and got a job at the Clark Shoe House.

One day, everything turned into your life. He was deputy manager of one of clark stores, 
and then the phenomena happened. Shoe boxes flew off the shelves, as if they had wings; 
established itself in the environment a true pandemonium. The entire press of São Paulo 
mobilized, recording sensationally the facts, which not even Mirabelli himself knew. 
A real crowd was planted in the vicinity of the store. He was called a priest to exorcism, 
for the press all regarded as exploits of the devil. Police officers were summoned to guard 
the store, which remained closed for several days, without finding the reason for that bad joke.

When they discovered that only with Mirabelli's presence the phenomena occurred, he was discharged and everything returned to normal.

Very competent in the shoe business, got a new job at Cia. Vilaça Shoes, the same phenomena occur there. They decided to intern him in juqueri's Sanitarium, because at this point the phenomena were frighteningly repeated. After scans were determined, the doctors discharged him, as he had nothing to be considered a mental patient.

Mirabelli moved to Rio de Janeiro, where a group of spiritists and scientists began research work around their physical effects mediumship.

From there, he was the target of all kinds of evidence by famous scientists, national sands and foreigners. He produced phenomena of materialization of Spirits in daylight, phenomena of levitation, transport, direct voice and so many others, undergoing all sorts of research, with the greatest seriousness, in predetermined environments. And the phenomena were repeated.

The facts were so interesting that President Washington Luiz and the Governor of São Paulo, Dr. Lacerda Franco, proposed to attend some sessions with the medium.

Dr. Carlos Frederico Spiccaci wrote: "I profess the purest materialism, but, in the face of the facts I have witnessed, I feel shaken and resort to the wise and materialistic to explain to me all this source of phenomena that I researched with the utmost seriousness, in the desire to clarify the truth."

Professor Eurico de Góes wrote the book Biopsychic Prodigies obtained with the medium Mirabelli, 472 pages, in 1937, in which he inserted statements from scientists of the highest jig.

Carmini Mirabelli defaced in the capital of São Paulo on April 30, 1951.
