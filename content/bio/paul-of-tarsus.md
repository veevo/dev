Born in Tarsus, in Cilicia of Asia Minor (15 km from the Mediterranean Sea), his
first name was Shaúl or Saulo, meaning "begged", "desired". Besides of the first
name in Hebrew or Aramaic, it was customary to have a second name latinized or
Hellenistic; and his second name was Paul.

Saul received a higher formation in Jerusalem. Since your youth, studied at the
feet of Gamaliel, grandson and disciple of the celebrated Dr. Hillel. It was the
Gamaliel's favorite disciple, called "the beauty of the law". With age
Gamaliel's advanced, Saul replaced him in the direction of the Sanhedrio in
Jerusalem.

Saulo had the profession of manufacturer of tents and other leather objects and
he had heard of the followers of the Nazarene and revolted when they referred to
him as if he were the Messiah.

The New Man and the Old Man: Young Saul was very proud, for belonging to a
traditional and conservative Jewish family; because it is considered the
greatest speaker among the doctors of Sanhedrin; the most fanatical defenders of
the Law of Moses.

He revolted as he encountered in those evil men, followers of Jesus, the
serenity in the face of any situation, which he desperately sought through the
violence it carried out in the name of the Law.

Honest to his principles, Saul persecuted Christians, like Jeziel, who to his
family destroyed and persecuted by the corrupt law of that time, changed his
name, becoming stephen.

## Saulo and Abigail 
At a certain ceremony, where he had invited the bride to watch her "coronation"
for his actions, Saul was preparing for trial and the death sentence for
stoning, of captured Christians, where one of them is Stephen, who is soon
recognized by her sister, Abigail. After her brother's death, Abigail undoes the engagement
and also becomes Christian; but he dies from a severe illness.

After the loss of his beloved bride, Saul revolts and departs towards Damascus behind
of the one who was responsible for his conversion, behind the one he thought was
your great enemy. I walked in front of a small caravan of soldiers,
extremely concerned, with contradictory feelings that would not know
Explain. He analyzed his life, which had been fully dedicated to the search for
truth in the teachings of his religion. His revolt grew because in his eyes,
in the smile, in the joy of the followers of the Nazarene, he noticed the presence of the
feelings that lacked him.


In these conflicting feelings came to his mind, the remarkable figures of
Abigail, her idolized bride and her brother Stephen, by her order murdered to
stoned, as was customary of the Law. Little did i know that these two beings desired
give you some guidance and encouragement.


At the gates of Damascus, he feels surrounded by a radiant cloud that overshadows him
the vision, has a vertigo and falls to the ground. He wants to call for help desperately,
but he can't, he wants to orient himself, but nothing can see when a soft voice
says, "Saul... Saul... Why are you chasing me?" 

He's initially placed-of-the-way
knees before the unknown, with an oppressive heart in an indefinable feeling
of veneration and love. Who would be that majestic entity, whose presence
flooded his heart and infused an unprecedented respect?
Who are you, Sir?
"I am Jesus, whom you persecute. Saulo, do not recalcitre against the aguilhões.

" Lord, what do you want me to do?
"Get into town, you'll know.

This begins, the great transformation of the Old Man, for the New Man! With the
name of PAUL!

Jesus' vision blinds him completely and is instructed to seek Ananias who
give him back his vision.


Saul perceives his own mistakes and for three profound years reflects on his
life and opens his heart to Jesus, becoming the greatest apostle of the
Christianity, having Stephen as his great spiritual advisor.


Paul faces much suffering, humiliation, adversity, but conquers his
true inner reform, being received in his passage to life
by Stephen, Abigail, Ananias among other friends.
