Born in the city of Icó, State of Ceará, on December 10, 1874, he was the son of Professor Tomás Antônio de Carvalho and D. Josefa Viana de Carvalho. He defaced aboard the iris ship, his body being buried in Bahia, apparently in Salvador. It was October 13, 1926.\r

At a time when the dissemination of the Spiritist Doctrine rehearsed its first steps and found ahead the most obstinate opposition, Major Dr. Manuel Viana de Carvalho, with a firm and lively pulse of the most vivid idealism, explored the ground to launch the generous seed of propaganda.\r

As a spiritist he was one of the most enthusiastic. 0 his name represented a true flag in the field of the spread of Spiritism. What he did, in several years of struggle and intense activities, is something that cannot yet be put into statistical data, such as the gigantism of the task he developed throughout the country.\r

His word was attractive and sweeping, achieving, among the spiritists, an unusual and unmistakable penetration. As a lecturer he was one of the most requested; as a polemist, one of the most salient. His inspired verb, his harmonious voice, his animation, sometimes assumed shades and impressive aspects. He was, in fact, a magician of the word, a stepof the feeling.\r

Viana de Carvalho did the first humanities studies at the Liceu de Fortaleza. Later, in 1891, he enrolled in the now defunct Military School of Ceará, where he deserved a prominent classification for his behavior and intellectual merits.\r

Although, since 1891, he began his gigantic task of disseminating Spiritism, it only took a large time after enrolling in the upper school of the former Red Beach Military School on February 11, 1895.\r

At that time the Center of the Spiritist Union of Propaganda in Brazil operated in Rio de Janeiro. Integrating this group, Viana de Carvalho began to deliver conferences that could attract compact auditoriums of more than 500 people. In 1896, he was transferred to Porto Alegre, as a student of the Military School that worked there.\r

In that southern capital, Spiritism was already widespread by some pioneers, including Joaquim Xavier Carneiro, leader of the Spiritist Group Allan Kardec, which, given its austerity of customs and humanitarian practices, exerted enormous influence. In possession of a list with the name and address of Spiritism sympathizers, Viana de Carvalho managed to gather everyone in an abandoned house, devoid of tables and chairs. Standing, the meeting goers listened, with real enlevo, their inflamed verb. Later, he managed to form a nucleus of studies that began to operate on the ground floor of a house in the city center.\r

In 1898, he published his first literary production Facetas, short stories and fantasies. He then published Colorful and Modulations. That same year he was transferred to Rio de Janeiro, where he resumed the selections at the Spiritist Union Center and other groups, participating in a congress and initiating numerous trips to the interior of the State of Rio de Janeiro.\r

Transferred to Cuiabá, Mato Grosso, founded the Cuiabano Spiritist Center. In 1907, he returned to Rio de Janeiro in order to enroll in the engineering course of the School of Realengo, becoming the official speaker of the Brazilian Spiritist Federation, while also making trips to the states of Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo. He was also an assiduous collaborator of reformador magazine.\r

After completing the military engineering course, he headed for Fortaleza, State of Ceará, in April 1910. There he started a series of spiritist conferences at loja Maçônica and, on June 10, founded the Spiritist Center Cearense. Dissatisfied with the activities developed, he also created the newspapers Combate and Lábaro, the first intended to challenge the arguments of the Catholic clergy, which at that time triggered a defamatory campaign against Spiritism, through the organ Cruzeiro do Sul; the second publication aimed at spreading Spiritism. Through the newspapers O Unitary, The Republic and Jornal do Ceará, kept alive controversies, refuting unfounded arguments about Spiritism. His activities in Fortaleza lasted until November 1911, when, by imposition of military service he was transferred to Curitiba, Paraná, where he maintained the same level of activities, publishing daily articles in the Daily Morning.\r

Back in Rio de Janeiro, in 1912, he began a persistent work of unification of spiritist groups, which resulted in the subsequent foundation of the Suburban Spiritist Union, under the presidency of Manuel Fernandes Figueira. In early 1913, he served in Maceió, where he delivered numerous conferences and embarked on a real journey to reorganize the spiritist groups dispersed or lacking orientation.\r

Shortly thereafter he was transferred to Recife, Pernambuco, where he continued his dissemination task, publishing numerous works, holding conferences and maintaining controversies that shook the religious means of the city. Returning to Rio de Janeiro, Viana de Carvalho resumed preaching the Spiritist Doctrine in the suburbs, which he did from 1914 to 1916, when she was transferred to Santa Maria da Boca do Monte, in the State of Rio Grande do Sul. There he also had the opportunity to reorganize and found several spiritist groups and hold conferences that were published in the Interior Gazette and later in other organs of the gaucho press.\r

In 1917, again in Rio de Janeiro, he developed an intense campaign against the fraud swindins and cheating of pseudo-spiritists. The following year, he returned to Santa Maria da Boca do Monte, in committee of the Federal Government, with the 9th Infantry Brigade, developing for fifteen months intense diffusion of Spiritism.\r

In 1919, again in Maceió, he was surprised by the activities of the detractors of Spiritism, who tried to ban his lectures and even expel him. Without fading, he fought intense debates by the press and the tribune, sustaining fierce controversies, having, at that time, his opponents pleaded, in Rio de Janeiro, his transfer, and being removed to the State of Paraná in the middle of that same year .\r

In Curitiba, he held conferences at the Teatro Alemão, at the headquarters of the Spiritist Federation of Paraná and other institutions. Through the Diary of the Afternoon, he published a series of doctrinal articles that had a lot of penetration.\r

From the capital of Paraná came to S. Paulo, where he gave several lectures, many of them attended by more than 1,000 people. In 1920, he returned again to Rio de Janeiro, from where he left to give conferences in neighboring cities.\r

In 1923, he went to Recife, reorganizing the Spiritist Centers there, maintaining new controversies with detractors of Spiritism. Subsequently, he headed to Ceará and from there to Sergipe, where he had been assigned to command the 28th B.C. in 1924. In this State, their activities were also extensive.\r

In 1926, he fell ill severely, and his collection was decided to be recollection to the Hospital de S. Sebastião in Salvador. His forces were perichloritean. Taken to the ship Iris, by fellow officers and soldiers, he could not, however, reach the destination, because at the time of Amaralina, he defaced on board, his body being given to the grave in Bahia.\r
