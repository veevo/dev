Camille Flammarion was born in France and spent her childhood, entering adolescence with a strong passion for Astronomy. Very young, he wrote a work of great breath on the universe, which came to fall into the hands of a doctor who had come to treat him, when he, impressing with the manuscript, decided to help the talented young man, in which resulted his entry into the Observatory of Paris as an astronomer.\r

As a young student, Flammarion had his first contact with Spiritism, joining the Parisian Society of Spiritist Studies, founded and directed by Allan Kardec.\r

In this opportunity he wrote the book "The Plurality of inhabited Worlds" when he came to know "The Book of Spirits" immediately identifying himself with the work. As the Society's sessions were partly dedicated to psychography, Flammarion began training, aiming to develop this college, and achieving, brought to light the work entitled "General Uranography" signed by Galileo and which is part of the work "The Genesis" by Allan Kardec. Participating in the main Parisian spiritist groups and being secretary of one of them Flammarion enriched his spirit and transcribed into the books the wonders that the invisible transmitted to them. "Earth has no prominence in the solar system in order to be the only inhabited world," he comments as he defended the theory that many other planets would be inhabited.\r

In 1865, under the title "Unknown Natural Forces" he published his first book on psychic research that was a critical study about the phenomena produced by the Davenport brothers and mediums in general.\r

When on March 31, 1869, Allan Kardec said, Flammarion was invited to utter one of the 4 prayers on the edge of the tomb, which made him impressing everyone by affirming the scientific character of Spiritism, the excellence of Kardec's work, the reality of physical sciences in the beyond, the existence of the soul and its indestructibility, eventually considering the disembodied the incarnating common sense incarnated. That same year the Dialectical Society of London began its investigations into the psychic phenomena, with Flammarion being presented before the committee which concluded as the final report, being the subject worthy of more serious attention and careful research than it had been until then.\r

In 1879, his book "Popular Astronomy" is published, considered the best work of its 19th century. He then began to study the psychic phenomenon in what resulted another book of his own, which took the title of "Mysterious Psychic Forces" where he notes: "The psychic phenomenon has for me the print of absolute certainty and uncontestability and extends enough to prove that unknown physical forces exist outside the ordinary and established mastery of natural philosophy."\r

In 1882, already highlighted as a professional, he installed a private observatory, knowing that science, notably Astronomy, as being an old counselor of spiritual truths, would greatly help men in their quests to find God. That same year he founded the magazine "Astronomy" and in 1887 the Astronomical Society of France.\r

In 1899, Flammarion began taking a census on hallucination. Of 4,280 people consulted, 1,824 responded that they had had visions of ghosts. Of this total, 786 cases were collected as evidence value. Reviewed and expanded, these articles formed the substance of the book "The Unknown and psychic problems", reinforcing the evidence of telepathy, appearances of the dead, premonitory dreams and clairvoyance. In the aforementioned work, in view of the whole facts, Flammarion concludes: 1º) the soul exists as a real personality, regardless of the body; 2º) the soul is gifted from faculties still unknown to science; 3) it can act and perceive, at a distance, without the senses as intermediaries; 4) the future is prepared beforehand; determined by the causes that will produce it. The soul perceives it a few times.\r

At the same time dedicated to psychic research, Flammarion developed fruitful studies in the field of Astronomy. In addition to this, he addressed topics about God, political and social reforms, evolution of man, phenomenon of death and psychic research. But evidently, that, as a popularizer of his favorite science, many of his works have dealt with astronomy. This is the case of "Urânia": "The mission of Astronomy is even higher. After I have made you feel and made known that the earth is nothing more than a city in the heavenly homeland, and that man is a citizen of heaven, to go further. Discovering the plan on which the physical universe is built, show that the moral universe is founded on that same plane; that the two worlds form but the same world, and that the Spirit governs matter. (...) Astronomy being is therefore, eminently and first of all, the guideline of Philosophy. And astronomical philosophy is the religion of the superior spirits."\r

That was Flammarion. A poet of heaven, God and nature. A researcher who had the dream of making science religion and religious science, balancing the spirit on his flights by infinity. Scientist emeritus, shining writer, galaxy prospector, dedicated all his talent in showing the wonders God created so that we could define and materialize peace. With the eye on the sky and his hand on paper he was poet enough to transport the stars to Earth, so that they would become just a tiny world lost in the universe. His name shines among the scholars of Spiritism as the suns he researched, and, there is no mist thicker, that one day it will overshadow the magnitude.\r
