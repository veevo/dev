By coding Spiritism, Kardec said of the valuable collaboration
of a spiritual entity whose communications always brought 'the nature of the
undeniable of depth and logic.'

"Disciple of São Paulo", in the statement also of the
Encoder, left pages revealing their identity with the Doctrine that
equal form had attracted the support of other Spirits of recognized elevation.

He made himself known by the name of Erasto.

The revelation that this entity had been a disciple of the apostle grid
Paul has a base.

Regardless of any other detail, it is appropriate to remember that
"The Book of Mediums", Chapter XIX, long message signed by
Erasto and Timothy. Two entities whose relationship came from the 1st century of the era
Christian.

With reference to Timothy, we have very affective expressions of part of
Paulo. In the 1st Epistle to the Corinthians[1], we can read: (...) for this reason
I have sent you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful son in the Lord, who will make you
remember my ways" (...) And in the 1st Epistle to Timothy: ...
true son in faith." [2] (...)

Similar expressions seem to indicate not only deep love
that Paul dedicated to Timothy, as he clearly lets him realize that
considered his spiritual father.

With respect to Erasmus, we identified a Christian who also
served Paul. In fact, in Acts of the Apostles,[3] we read: "... Sending the 
Macedonia two of those who ministered, Timothy and Erasto, himself (Paul) was
some time in Asia." (...)

It is the same Age that the 2nd Epistle speaks to Timothy[4] that
let stay in Corinth, perhaps because he was the treasurer of the city, and that
together with Paul sent greetings to the brothers in Rome, greetings that
let's locate the Romans in the Epistle. [5]

We can check, in this way, quickly go from views through
some books that make up the New Testament, the approximation between Paul, Timothy
and Erasto.

EDICEL - Editora Cultural Espírita Ltda - which in our country
published the volumes of the Spiritist Magazine for the years 1858 to 1869,
exactly in that corresponding to 1869, catalogued a series of
personalities who from 1858 had collaborated with papers for the
mentioned magazine or even who received citations on their pages (Index
Bibliography).

Although they are succinct data, however, they give a satisfactory idea
to the reader.

With regard to Erasto, we read:
> "Thomaz Liber, said Erasto, german doctor, philosopher and theologian,
was born in 1524 and died in 1583. He was professor of medicine in Heidelberg and
Morale in Basel. He fought Paracelsus' ideas. In Theology he did not admit the
temporal power of the Church, and only granted her the role of persuasion. Bequeathed sums
to poor students."

In the spiritist press body itself that had kardec's direction,
we find several messages signed by Erasmus, all characterized by
an extraordinary depth of concepts, collaboration that we will also
"The Gospel according to Spiritism" and "The Book of
Mediums."

Expanding references regarding Thomaz Liber - or Lüber -
with the Latinized form Erastus, it is easy to imagine that Baden and Basel -- which
respectively they saw him born and disincarnated -- they would be for a long time
time in remembrance of his posters.
Some by your side.
Others radically opposed.
All, consequence of the ideas of the well-known doctor, philosopher,
German teacher and theologian.
The question of the Church's doctrine of submission to the State,
for example, raised careless quarrels, to the point of making the
Erastianism, doctrine of the Erastians, that is, of those who accepted the
thought that only civil magistrates could inflict sentences
and excommunicate heretics, contrary to what Calvin taught. Years later the
the term would apply to the English school, which also refused to give autonomy to the
church, based on the thought that, in the State, supreme authority must be
one: that of secular power!

For reason, therefore, of this reasoning -- which was actually a
scandal for the time -- became Erastianism practically doctrine
officer in England, for it was accepted -- at least largely -- by
Hooker, then submitting himself to the Anglican Church to the King and Parliament.
(At this point it is good to remember that Erastianism also made
denmark and sweden during that period.)

Erasto's reaction to Astrology, Alchemy, and the Magic of
Paracelsus, there was no truce.

It wonders today: would this reaction be the result of its appreciable
Culture?

From the course he had made in Basel, of Theology?
Philosophy and Medicine in Bologna and Padua?
Of the nine years of research conducted in Italy?
From the experience gained as professor of Medicine and Ethics, in
Basel?
Or it would be a reaction whose roots were located and, lives
preterites?...

His posture was well defined.

In the field of theology he was sectarian of Zwingli, firmly opposing
discipline and presbyterian order. He didn't miss it, remember, a
excommunication under false suspicion of heresy, but managed to be rehabilitated some
time later.

Truth is that your theories have reached many supporters.
Especially in England, where even a synod at Westminster met.
(About between 1643 and 1652).

If it dominated by the firmness of thought, it was, on the other hand,
respected by the gestures of benemerence, mainly in favor of students
devoid of financial resources.

But, abstracting himself from his struggle against the Church, another fact that had
great repercussion was that related to the person of Paracelsus. A reaction
which actually exceeded borders.  
Possibly by the projection of the contenders.

Perhaps as a result of the contrary theses adopted by the two.
In fact, there was around Paracelsus an atmosphere of complexity.
An enigmatic halo.

It was called Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, but had adopted the name
alatinate - and somewhat pompous - by Philippus Aureolus Paracelsus. (Adopting the
epithet of Paracelsus, wanting to mean his superiority over Celsus, the
Swedish archaeologist who had deciphered the rones of the Helsingland.)
His disincarnation was never well explained, believing that
ended his days in Salzburg, treacherously poisoned, being intoxicated and
asleep, according to prayer a tradition.
Like his opponent Erasto, Paracelsus was also a doctor. However
received in his time a curious complementation: "Luther of Medicine".
The reason for such designation has its motive.
Having studied at the Universities of Basel, Tubingen, Vienna,
Wittenberg, Leipzig, Heidelberg and Cologne, but he graduated in Vienna and
Ferrara.

After serving in 1521 as a military surgeon in Italy,
returned to Switzerland, preceded by great fame. His first initiative was to post
a conference program at the door of the University of Basel. In these same
conferences exposed with ardor revolutionary ideas in the field of culture,
exciting how many listened to him. Three weeks after his exposures, he burned
in the middle of the street, in front of the building of this University, works of Galeno,
Avicenna and Rhazis.

From this impetuous gesture came the expression: "Luther of Medicine".
Paracelsus's vision of man closes points
Unique. Not to say strangers.

According to him, life would be governed by an immaterial principle, the
which is manifested in three different ways: salt, and sulphur and
Mercury. The combination of these elements forms the clay from which the body is made
human; its separation characterizes the disease.

He, however, had clear ideas about other sectors.
  In the year 1530, he made an objective description of syphilis,
advising mercury as a medicine for its cure. With what anticipated
(according to BARSA), the use of Salvarsan, which would appear only in 1909!
He found that the so-called "miners' disease" was silicosis and not
punishment of God, as believed in that time.

And what is very surprising, suggested the principle of similitude, the
value of the individualization of the remedy and the patient, the basis of Samuel's Homeopathy
Hahnemann, who is from 1810! [6]

In 1534, a curious fact involved the figure of Paracelsus.
When that year the plague appeared in Sterlzing, it healed numerous
its inhabitants with a bread crumb pill, in which it inserted, with a
needle, an infinitesimal amount of the patient's feces!
Embota has Paracelsus, in the course of its existence, committed
serious mistakes, truth is that he had the courage to free himself from certain crendices,
exerted great influence in the field of medicine.

According to some biographers, it deserves to be considered a precursor in the
trend that, later, with more solid bases, there would be a search for
physiology, pharmacology and pathology.

This creature with whom Erasto kept controversy.
I ask again: which side would the reason be?
After so many years, distanced, we, from a
reality of facts, of circumstances, difficult to present proper response.
A fact, however, is evidenced: the interest they both had for
study of subjects in an incipient state, the desire of both to always go more
far away, seeking to cross borders demarcated by the common man.

At this point of work, I can't help but make room for a
slight and necessary rambling, reference made to the name: Erasto.

As readers will have noticed by reading the text
presented, we are compelled to reason in the sense that the aforementioned
signature - Erasto - has correlation with two personalities.
1st) Erasto - disciple of Paul of Tarsus in the 1st century;
2nd) Erasto - german physician, philosopher, teacher and theologian who lived in the sixteenth century.

A curious detail presents us: 
spiritist magazine, 1869, in the Biobibliographic Index, not
there is mention that there had been Erasto a disciple of Paul. At the same time, there is no
exist, in "The Book of Mediums", informs that it was the Spirit that
had an incarnation in the 16th century.

I clarify, however, to readers, the target of this work.
What really matters is the respectable task developed both to the
the time of the Apostle Paul as to the time of Kardec, by a Spirit.
In the first case, incarnated, it highlights the dissemination really
extraordinary that made Christianity the nascent Christianity enterprise this, moreover,
held in fields not always welcoming.

In the second, the precise elucidations that the spiritual entity
presented in favor of the codification of the Spiritist Doctrine at a time when
Kardec assiduously consulted the Greater Spiritual Plan, seeking a
sufficient amount of responses to vitally important topics!          

Impossible in this work to simply appreciate around each
of the messages that the Erasto Spirit left in the works of Codification,
particularly in the numbers of the Spiritist Magazine, where the most pronounced was its
Participation. In this way, I will limit myself only to a few transcripts
of excerpts That I think of current affairs - inside or outside the Doctrine
Spiritist - despite the time elapsed since its publication.

### I - "The Gospel according to Spiritism" 
In this work, we have three
messages that are presented in Chapters XX and XXI.
In the first, Mission of Spiritists, after making Erasto an appeal
in favor of the work of the dissemination of Spiritism, he answers a question
of the following content:

> "If, among the calls for Spiritism, many have crossed,
which signs will we recognize those who are on the way?"

Let's see an excerpt of the answer.

> "You will recognize you by the principles of true charity that they
will teach and practice. You will recognize them ... for personal disinterest;
you will finally recognize you by the triumph of its principles, because God wants to
the triumph of his law; (...)"

The second message - Characters of the true prophet - is very
when we consider the incalculable number of those who get trees, on the days
current, in conductors of collectivities.  
Let's look at the following excerpt:

> "In a word: true prophets reveal themselves by their acts,
are guessed, while false prophets give themselves, as
sent from God. The former is humble and modest; the second, proud and full
speaks with altimeire and, like all the scathing, always seems fearful of
not to give you credit. (Featured of the original).

Finally, in the third message - The false prophets of the
erraticity -, we read:

> "In general, I mistrusted the communications that bring a character of
mysticism and uniqueness, or who prescribe ceremonies and acts
Fancy. There is always, in such cases, a legitimate reason for suspicion."
(Featured of the original).
Undeniably, excellent warnings with reference to the days in
that we live...

### II - "The Book of Mediums" - When I refer to the work published in
1861, I make it clear that I will not take care of this or that message left by the
Erasto Spirit. I chose to transcribe only two excerpts of Kardec himself.
I chose to transcribe only two excerpts of Kardec himself, to exactly
confirm what was said at the beginning of this article, concerning the entity
that, from the Spiritual Plan, greatly helped the Encoder.
In the Chapter of The Expontaneous Physical Manifestations, segment
transport phenomena, Kardec writes:
"The theory of the phenomenon of transport and physical manifestations
in general, it is briefed, in a remarkable way, in the following dissertation made
by a Spirit, whose communications all bear the undeniable nature of
depth and logic. With many of them will come across the reader in the course of this work.
He becomes known by the name of Erasto, a disciple of São Paulo, and as
protector of the medium who served as an instrument. [7] (...) (I highlighted.)
And in Chapter XIX - From the Role of Mediums in Spiritist Communications
- we can read: (no. 225):

"The dissertation that follows, given spontaneously by a Spirit
which was revealed through very high-order communications, summarizes,
clearly and completely, the question of the role of the medium (...)" (I highlighted.)

As we noticed, kardec spared no complimentary references to the
Erasto Spirit, who signed communication in conjunction with Timothy.

### III - Spiritist Magazine - 
As has already been said we find in
copies of this body of dissemination of Spiritism, at the time of Kardec,
numerous messages signed by Erasto.
In this article I gathered some excerpts, putting the necessary
titles for a better script.

True or false theories - "(...) Better repel ten
truths that admit a 'lie only, one false theory.' (...) (August
1861. Repeated in "The Book of Mediums", Cap. XX, no. 230.)
Moral heredity - "... We have repeated to you many times that
similarities are due to a material and physiological issue absolutely
regardless of spiritual action and that as regards skills and tastes
these result, not from the procreation of the soul, by another soul already
born, but because similar spirits attract." (...) (July 1862.)
Progress of Spiritism - "When the most eminent men,
belonging to liberal functions, people of science, study, physicians,
philosophers and jurisconsults are resolutely launched into the search for truth in the new
routes opened by Spiritism; when the militant class comes to seek
consolations and new forces, who, therefore, among humans, would be judged
strong enough to oppose a barrier to the development of this new science
philosophical?" (...)

Elements to cure possession cases -- "Not only did a
material and moral action, but still a purely spiritual action." (...) (January
1854.)

More in detail Erasto says of these actions:
a) material = an experienced magnetizer of these actions;
b) moral = that this magnetizer is of a morality
irreprochable of spiritist truth;
c) spiritual = the energetic action of a good disembodied Spirit.
Earth problems - "How many problems and issues to be solved before
human transformation is carried out according to spiritist ideas! The
education of spirits and the Incarnates, from a moral point of view, is in this
Number. (...) (July 1865.)

(Here the unrestrained cry of a Spirit. How many problems
envisioned the spiritual entity! How many redemptive fights! How many
sacrifices would be required! How much responsibility on the shoulders of the
Spiritists!)

Presence of Erasto in the work of dissemination of Spiritism -
> "March, therefore, undisturbably on your road, without worrying about the
mockery of one and the self-love of others. We are and will stay with you, under the
aegis of the Spirit of Truth, ours and your Master." (February 1868.)

### IV - "Heaven and Hell"
In order not to take more extensive the present
work, just inform that we will find in this work two messages that
were transmitted by a Spirit who signed the name in the French form
You were both in the second part of the book in the Caps. VII AND VIII. This is a question of
assessments of messages given by other entities in the Parisian Society
Spiritist Studies (I want to believe that it was the erasto himself the author of the
two messages mentioned above.)

#### Note
In "Posthumous Works", Part 2, we become aware that in
Paris, on 30 September 1863, serving as medium Mr. d'A the Spirit
of E. gave a message in which he referred to the future of the church.
By the style of the communicator I am led to admit that this is the
Spirit Erasto who manifested himself through the mediumship of Mr. d'Ambel.

The superior spirits there are always ready to help us.
In the twentieth century Kardec we had the Spirit of Truth, Erasmus, John
Evangelist, St. Augustine, Saint Vincent de Paul, St. Louis, Carita and so many,
so many others.

Today, new spiritual entities add to that pleiade,
seeking to further streamline the evolution of our planet.
Development, among others, is the basic principle of the Doctrine
Spiritist, we can say that we are step by step on the way to Love, good,
of the Light in its fullness.

Gradually eliminating problems and issues.
As the Spirit Wassto wisely said!
