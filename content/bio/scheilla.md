Scheilla is the name of a spirit to which Brazilian mediums like Chico Xavier
and João Nunes Maia attribute the authorship of certain psychographed works.

France According to spiritist accounts, in one of their past lives, Scheila
would have lived in France, as Joana Francisca Frémiot (Dijon, 28 January 1572 -
Moulins, 13 December 1641). 

He married the baron of Chantal at the age of 20. Having lost her husband very
early, abandoned the world with his four children, sharing his time between
prayers, the pious works and their mother's duties. In 1604, having come to
preach in Dijon, the bishop of Geneva, St. Francis of Salles, underwent his
spiritual direction. 

They founded, in Annecy, the Congregation of the Visitation of Mary (1610),
which counted, at the time of her death, with 87 convents and, in the first
century, with 6,500 religious. The baroness of Chantal directed, as superior,
from 1612 to 1619 the house she had founded in Paris, in the neighborhood of St.
Anthony.

In Paris, they settled in small rented house in poor neighborhood. They went
through great needs, but the Order of Visitation (of Paris) increased and
overcome the difficulties. In 1619, São Vicente de Paulo was superior of the
Convent of the Order of Visitation. Saint Joan of Chantal left the position of
superior of the Order of Visitation and returned to Annecy, where the mother
house of the order was. The Saint repeatedly saw Saint Vincent de Paul, his
confessor and spiritual director.

She was married, at the age of 20, by the baron of Chantal. In 1604, having
heard preach in Dijon, the bishop of Geneva, St. Francis of Salles, underwent
his spiritual direction. Together they founded, in Annecy, the Congregation of
the Visitation of Mary (1610), which, at the time of her death, already had 87
convents and, in the first century of existence, with 6,500 religious. 

The baroness of Chantal drove, as superior, from 1612 to 1619 the house she
founded in Paris, in the district of St. Anthony. She left the position of
superior of the Order of Visitation and returned to Annecy, where the mother
house of order. She was canonized in 1767 by the Catholic Church as Saint Joan
of Chantal.

### Germany
In another incarnation, under the name of Scheilla, he would have lived in Germany at the time of the 
World War II. At the age of 28, when she worked as a nurse in Hamburg, 
died during an Allied bombing in 1943.

According to some versions, the spirit would have materialized for the first time through the medium 
Francisco Peixoto Lins (Peixotinho), macaé, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, circa 1943, 
still during World War II. 

Others refer to this date as 1948, in the meetings of the Spiritist Center André Luís in the city of Rio de Janeiro.

Peixotinho, in Macaé (RJ), began a prayer work for the victims of The Second Great War. 
It was then that suddenly he came there and materialized a Spirit named Rodolfo, 
who said he was from a legitimately spiritist family, living in Germany. 
He had to serve in the war as a medical officer and his father, Dr. Fritz, very reserved, polite, 
severe, very authentic, who passed many humanitarian ideas to his children, had told him: 
− Kill never. To which Rodolfo replied: − Father, this is not it, I will serve as a doctor.

## Brazil
On one occasion, Dr. Rodolfo was called as an officer to join a firing squad. 
He then said, − My mission is to save, not kill. And, according to military regulations, 
he came to be considered a criminal, because he ceased to serve the homeland, for the homeland asked the 
him to kill someone and he refused. So they said to him, −Since you're not going to execute this man, 
You're going to stand next to him to die like a traitor. And he was shot at the same time. 
At this point, he spoke (spiritually) to his father and said: 
– (PT) Father, I'm already in the other dimension of life. I kept the word committed: I didn't kill, I preferred to die. 

So that he would not continue in the war environment, he was spiritually supported here, in the 
Spiritist Group Pedro (Macaé-RJ). Peixotinho, for being military, for fair reason, as a spiritist, 
had this work of prayer for the benefit of the victims of war and peace.

And these facts took place at the height of World War II, almost at the end. One day, Rodolfo (Spirit) 
said, thus, in the Peixotinho Prayer Group: − Pray for my sister, she is in danger. 
And as the German's voice, through the direct voice by ectoplasmia, was not quite sharp, a loaded accent, 
the pronunciation of his sister's name did not come out good, instead of Scheilla, Ceila left. 

After a few days he said: − My sister just disembodied. He was the victim of aviation bombing. 
She and my father disembodied. Days later, to the team's pleasant surprise, a young blonde materialized 
and said: − I am Scheilla. It was a lot of joy! The brothers were filled with spiritual joys.

* Rodolfo, the first few times he psychographed messages, signed The Shot.
