Ernesto Bozzano was born in Genoa on January 9, 1862, the fourth child of a total of five brothers from a wealthy family. In 1948, Bozzano wrote to doctor Dr. Humberto Torres: having been born in a Spiritist family I had, at my disposal, the numerous books that my father has acquired and, moreover, throughout my life, the chance to witness several of the interesting facts in them Reported.\r

His first approach in the study of Spiritism was that of denial of the phenomenon. The detailed study led him to later become one of his most important writers. He was a positivist thinker. His first forays in the studies of the Spiritist phenomenon, through the works of Alexandre Aksakov in Animism and Spiritism and The Ghosts of the Living Room (Phantasms of the Living), by Gurnes Myers, definitely converted him into a psychic researcher.\r

Bozzano began writing articles on mediumship from 1900. In 1920, he met Gastone De Boni who, after Bozzano's death, inherited all his scientific material.\r

He was President of Honor of the 5th International Spiritist Congress, held from September 1 to 10, 1934, in Barcelona, Spain. For his performance and work he received a beautiful gold medal from the English spiritists, which contained the following phrase: To the great Master of the Soul, Ernesto Bozzano, who opened new radiohorizons to suffering humanity, from his friends and admirers.\r

Ernesto Bozzano has produced more than sixty works in his entire life. These works are available in Portuguese, in the so-called Full Works of Bozzano; his monographs were collected in the book Selections, from the same series, Ed. Livraria Allan Kardec Editora, 1949. Translations by Francisco Klors Wernek.\r
His most important works are Animism or Spiritis-mo, Metapsychic Humana, Enigmas of Psychome-tria, Psychic Phenomena, among others. He was also one of the first to study the metapsychic phenomena produced by animals. This research highlights the case of Elberfeld's horses, which a farmer taught his animals to do mathematical operations. Even today there are doubts about these achievements; however, at that time, the facts were studied and considered real.\r

Ernesto Bozzano died on 24 June 1943 in Savona, Italy. He has never neglected his research, having participated in numerous sessions with Eusapia Palladino, one of the greatest mediums of physical effects that has been reported to this day.\r

When Bozzano died, Gastoni de Boni (1908 – 1986) inherited his entire library. Such material allowed Silvio Ravaldini to elaborate an extensive biography of Ernesto Bozzano (Ernesto Bozzano e la Ricerca Psichica –Vita e opere di un pionere della parapsicologia, ed. Mediterranee, Rome, 1993).\r
Gastone de Boni then created a society called the Fondazione Bozzano De Boni Library, which features an Internet site, with this same name. Currently this foundation is chaired by Silvio Rivaldini. On the site it is possible to access the bibliography of Bozzano and Boni, as well as the current publications of the Foundation. It's worth checking out.\r

The study of Bozzano's works allows the spiritist to get used to the methodical analysis of the facts, separating them from the assumptions. In addition, the scholar will have the great opportunity to expand his knowledge. We can still find in the spiritist bookstores several works of this that was the last great European spiritist scientist. After Bozzano only came the metapsychotics and parapsychologists.\r
