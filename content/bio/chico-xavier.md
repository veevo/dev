The world's largest and most prolific psychic medium in all eras, Francisco
Cândido Xavier was born in Pedro Leopoldo, a modest city of Minas Gerais, on
April 2, 1910, disembodiment on June 30, 2002, the son of João Cândido Xavier
and his mother Maria João de Deus , who had nine children: Maria Cândida, Luíza,
Carmozina, José Cândido, Maria de Lurdes, Francisco Cândido, Raymundo, Maria da
Conceição and Geralda. His mother defaced in 1915 and in 1960 his father.

At that time, the municipality of Pedro Leopoldo was a small, quiet town of
bandeirante tradition, without attractions, quiet life and rudimentary commerce,
having only agriculture as the most important basis of subsistence.

The arrival of heavy industry, steel, cement factories and others caused a major
transformation in the municipality, causing development and population increase.
As a result, quiet life was no longer part of Pedro Leopoldo's scenario. The
municipality became known nationally from the 1930s, when the first news of
Chico Xavier's fame arrived in the big cities.

In 1915, Dona Maria João de Deus, realizing the severity of her illness and
sensing the next unflesh, gave her children to friendly people, to take care of
their education. Faced with such circumstances, Chico was handed over to his
godmother, Dona Rita de Cássia, better known as Ritinha.

[WARNING] Connection timed out. Retrying IPv4 connection.  Realizing the
separation of his family, the boy Chico asked his mother why it was happening,
without understanding the severity of the situation and, very innocently, came
to think that the mother did not love them anymore. Mrs. Maria, managing to
overcome her emotions, told her that she was preparing to leave the house under
health care and that she would return soon to take care of everyone. Resigned to
the situation, she accepted the final words of her mother, who came to
disincarnate the next day, September 29.

## Life with your Godmother
Dona Ritinha led by her constant nervous crises, punished Chico with beatings that came to happen up to three times a day. The boy's life was full of disappointment and trials, which could have made him a revolted and unhappy being; however, this did not occur because of the spiritual richness it possessed.

Since the age of 4, the chico boy had his life marked by singular manifestations. His father even came to believe that his true son had been traded for another. That son of yours was weird!

Of Catholic formation, the boy prayed with extreme devotion, as his beloved mother, Dona Maria João de Deus, had taught him that he would leave him orphanat 5 years old.

Within great conflicts and extreme difficulties, the boy grew, always pure and good, unable to have an obscene word, of a gesture of disobedience. The "shadows" friends, however, did not leave him...

At school, I felt the presence of these friends helping him in the usual tasks. Chico always recognized that his early years marked him deeply; he never forgot them.

One fine day, Chico addressed the godmother, very happy, saying that he had talked to his disincarnated mother, which was enough to receive an extra beating. This conversation with his mother was Chico's first experience in the field of mediumship. However, he continued to have visions and conversations with his mother, which always told the godmother. Dona Ritinha then decided to talk about the parish priest of the place, who recommended Chico to pray a thousand Hail Marys with a stone of 15 kg on top of her head during the procession. Not only that, Chico was hit by a few bites, which some time later turned into a strangled hernia, which accompanied him to the end of his life.

In his visions, his mother advised him to be patient. He explained to him that he could not take him to himself and sought to help him overcome the bridesmaid's mistreatment. Another unfortunate fact occurred when Dona Ritinha learned that the only way to heal the infected wound of her other adopted son, nephew Moacir, was Chico licking the wound for three weeks in a row, in complete fasting.

In charge of this task, Chico was desperate to the backyard, where he evoked his mother's help; having received from her words that at that moment comforted him. And when he started penance, he realized with surprise that his mother put a little pozinho on the wound. And so, shortly after Moacir's leg was healed.

Despite so many mistreatment, to this day there has never been a single word attributed to Chico Xavier complaining about his godmother. On the contrary, he says that his godmother Rita's temperament was benevolent.

The need to work early to assist in domestic expenses was, in his life, as he himself says, an indefinable blessing. The disease had also come early to keep him company: first the problem in the lungs, when working in weaving; then the eyes; and finally later the angina, who companyed him until his final moments of physical life.

### Your Father's New Marriage
Chico's coexistence with his godmother Dona Ritinha lasted two years, because in 1917 his father married Dona Cidália Batista for the second time, whose union made the Xavier family grow with the birth of six more children: André Luís, Lucília, Neusa, Cidália, Doralice and John Candide. Moreover, by God's blessings, Ms Cidalia made a point of bringing together all the children of John Candido. Thus, Chico moved to them, to a coexistence of understanding and affection for ten years, between father, mother and fifteen children!

### First Inexplicable Fact
The Spirits continued to appear and send messages by Chico, but he feared being labeled crazy if he talked to someone about the conversations he kept with "souls of the other world"; although he realized what was going on to his volva and in his absence, he could not explain how the phenomena were given, including in the period of the only four years of primary instruction he received.

Chico himself says that in 1922, in the first centenary of The Independence of Brazil, all students had to present a dissertation on the date, and moments before starting the dissertation Chico saw a man at his side dictating what he should write. Frightened, he went to talk to the teacher who advised him to write what he had heard, calming him down: "Nobody told him anything. What you heard came from your own head." This work earned the chico boy his first Honorable Mention.

### Difficulties in doctrinal study 
It was great the difficulty that our Chico had to reconcile catholic teachings, which were imposed on him, with the psychic manifestations only explained by spiritism. However, he decided to devote himself to reading about the Spiritist Doctrine at the age of seventeen, just when he lost his second mother Dona Cidália, who defaced on April 19, 1931; resolving his father no longer married, until his disincarnation occurred on September 6, 1960, in the city of Pedro Leopoldo at the age of 92.

Chico continued his doctrinal studies despite Father Sebastião, who was the family counselor and the same who prescribed him the thousand Hail Marys as penance to end the "hauntings", make it clear that the Catholic Church did not approve of the Spiritism.

### Beginning of Mediumship
Decided, Chico deepens his knowledge by researching Allan Kardec and increasingly dedicating himself to psychic development. On May 7, 1927 he participated in his first spiritist meeting.

### Partnership with Emmanuel
Chico Xavier's psychography work was started on July 8, 1927, in Pedro Leopoldo. At the age of 17, he received the first psychic pages.

On that memorable date, the Spirits began one of the most beautiful works in the entire history of mankind. Seventeen sheets of paper were filled, quickly, dealing with the duties of the Christian Spiritist.

Until 1931, Chico psychographed many poetry and messages, several of which were published, in absentia of the medium, in newspapers and magazines throughout Brazil.

That same year, you have the opportunity to see, for the first time, the Spirit of noble Benefactor Emmanuel, his inseparable spiritual mentor until the last day of his stay among us.

The well-known Benefactor Emmanuel, when presenting himself to the medium, told him of the work that spirituality had pre-established for them, and if Chico accepted the mission that was to disseminate spiritism, he would need to follow three fundamental requirements, without the which work would not succeed.

So he asked him the following question: − Are you really willing to work in mediumship with Jesus?
− Yes, if the good spirits do not abandon me... − answered the medium.
− You will not be helpless − Emmanuel told him − but for that you need to work, study and strive on good.
− And do you think I'm in a position to accept the commitment? − made Chico.
− Perfectly, as long as you try to respect the three basic points for the Service...

Because the protector shut up, the boy asked, − What's the first?

The answer came firmly: − Discipline.
− What about the second? − Discipline.
− What about the third? − Discipline.

### Emmanuel's guidance to the Medium 
Emmanuel's second most important orientation for the medium is so remembered by Chico: I remember that in one of the first contacts with me, he warned me that he intended to work beside me for a long time, but that I should, above all, look for the teachings of Jesus and the lessons of Allan Kardec and, he said more, that if one day he, Emmanuel, something advised me not to agree with the words of Jesus and Kardec, that I should remain with Jesus and Kardec, seeking to forget him.  

### Switch to Uberaba
On January 5, 1959, Chico moved to Uberaba, under the guidance of spiritual Benefactors, starting, on that same date, the mediumistic activities, in a public meeting of the Christian Spiritist Communion. Starting from there on the famous pilgrimage that took place on Saturdays, leaving the "Christian Spiritist Communion" to personally visit some needy homes, bringing them the joy of their friendly presence, accompanied by a large number of people also willing to this kind of work, in the light of the stars and a lantern that was moving ahead, illuminating the dark streets of the periphery, he was telling facts of great spiritual beauty.

The city of Uberaba, thus, became a pole of attraction of countless visitors from the most varied regions of Brazil, and even from abroad, who went there with the objective of knowing the medium. The cities of Pedro Leopoldo and Uberaba are in the heart of Chico in equal plane, as he always said. His love for both cities is thus justified by him: "Pedro Leopoldo is my cradle and Uberaba is my blessing."

### Literary Production
In 1932, his first book was published by FEB, the to date famous and discussed Parnaso de Além-Tomb; his production then had no more end, while the medium was among us. He was the author of 412 works, several of them translated and published in Spanish, Esperanto, French, English, Japanese, Greek etc.

Carrying an unblemished moral, impressive humility and undisputed simplicity, Chico Xavier never accepted advantages of any kind, or appropriated any privilege from his unparalleled mediumship.

His private and public life has been the subject of all possible speculation, in spoken, written and televised information; accusations and criticism soores were supported by him with the example of the true spiritist.

He traveled with medium Waldo Vieira to the United States and Europe, where they visited England, France, Italy, Spain and Portugal, always at the service of the Spiritist Doctrine.

### Tributes You Received 
Chico Xavier is today a figure of national and international projection, his interviews attract the attention of thousands of people, even those others to Spiritism; in all the opportunities he was in TV shows, answering questions from the most diverse, he got his answers by the Spiritist postulates. He was honored with the title of Honorary Citizen of several cities: São José do Rio Preto, São Bernardo do Campo, Franca, Campinas, Santos, Catanduva, in São Paulo; Uberlândia, Araguari and Belo Horizonte, in Minas Gerais; Campos, in the State of Rio de Janeiro etc. 

He was elected the "Mineiro of the Century", surpassing even prominent characters in the history of Brazil and the world, such as Santos Dumont, the father of aviation. In addition, the great proof of popular recognition for his work was the strong campaign to receive the Nobel Peace Prize in 1981. In this mishap, approximately ten million Brazilians endorsed the campaign, signing manifestos and letters.

## The Death of Chico Xavier
Chico returned to the spiritual homeland on the night of June 30, 2002, the way he always said he would like to die: on a day of joy for the Brazilian people. It was served on its purpose, since exactly on that date Brazil won the World Cup for the fifth time, on an unforgettable Sunday. He was 92 years old, had various health problems and had a cardiac arrest; Chico would complete 75 years of mediumistic activity on July 8, 2002.

All we have to do is thank you for everything you have done for the benefit of all humanity and say from the bottom of our late hearts:

"Thank you very much, friend Chico."

The Spiritist Center in Chico's Vision

Spiritist centers should be places of prayer, work and study. Knowing Spiritism is of fundamental importance, but, according to Emmanuel, this knowledge needs to be translated into practice, starting with understanding among the companions who make up the team of co-workers of the house. The phenomenon at a time of kardecist orientation should be accessory and, without a doubt, special activity.

For me, spiritist center had to open every day, all day... If it's a hospital, as we say, how can it be behind closed doors?... The center needed to organize itself to better serve those in need. What prevents the spiritist center from being more productive is the centralization of tasks; there is a leader who does not give up the command of the institution... Now, in fact, the institution needs command, but a command that cares about creating space for colleagues to work, without anyone being more concerned about positions than with charges...

The spiritist center, the simpler, the more humble, the more stronghold of the Gospel. Colossal constructions always seem unseated to me in spirit... The Spiritist Society of Paris was a room of scant dimensions: there prevailed the spirit of brotherhood.

Meetings in spiritist centers could be more productive. There is a leader who opens and ends the session by looking at the clock... I can't guess at the center of others − Emmanuel would have kept my mouth shut –, but we are sad about the spiritist centers that operate only half an hour during the week...

We do not need to wait for the formation of a spiritist group to receive holy people; the most unfortunate will arrive first; will count the sorrows, sometimes even their crimes; come in search of love...

We do not own the Movement, the spiritist house has no owners ... Let's create opportunity for the growth of others. No one needs to nullify anyone... There's room for the stars in the firmament! Everyone can shine at will...

If a friend, or friends, has no patience with us, the groups do not prosper, do not bear fruit in love, in hope, in spiritual help...

The spiritist center should be played as a school, that is, we must be inside it to learn... It's not just for mediumship, pass or deosession... We need to study the lessons of Jesus, the interpretations of Allan Kardec, and to experience them, taking care of ourselves, our necessary intimate renewal...

Boy Responds

During the interview, Chico was asked: − Chico, they are wanting to separate the scientific, philosophical and religious part of the Doctrine, saying that Spiritism is not religion, that is, they are wanting to take Jesus from Spiritism. What do you think of all this?

The Answer was not expected:

– (PT) If we take Jesus out of Spiritism, it becomes comedy. If we take Religion out of Spiritism, it becomes a business. The Spiritist Doctrine is science, philosophy and religion. If we take away religion, what's it staying?

Human philosophy, although it is an endless conversation, has helped lighten thought, but it does not comfort before the pain of a dead son.

Human science, although it is an endless question, is there in the name of God.

In the past we had smallpox, but God, inspiring human intelligence, gave us the vaccine and today smallpox is almost eliminated from the face of the earth.

We suffered from the problem of distance, but divine goodness, inspiring the heads of scientists, brought us the engine. Today we have the boat, the car, the plane suppressing distances... the phone relieving anxieties... television has put the world inside our homes...

We were afraid of darkness, but divine mercy sent us the lamp through human creativity.

Pain tormented us, but divine compassion sent us anesthesia.

There is, however, something that science has not been able to help. She has failed to eliminate hatred of the human heart. There are no pharmacies selling medicines against selfishness, pride, vanity, envy, jealousy... We can't ask a computer for mercy.

Jesus, however, is in our daily experience, because in our difficulties and trials, the first name we remember, capable of providing us with relief and comfort, is JESUS.

So that if we take away the religion of Spiritism, a heartless body is left, if we take away science, a body is headless and if we take away philosophy, a limbless body is left.

(Interviews with Chico Xavier)                    
The Return of the Apostle Chico Xavier

When he plunged into the physical body, for the ministry he was supposed to develop, everything was expectations and promises.

Snawed with unusual heritage of blessings, especially in the area of mediumship, Messengers of Light promised to inspire and support him throughout the time he found himself in the physical trajectory, warning him of the dangers of crossing in the chapeled sea of the passions, as well as the struggles it should fight to reach the safe harbor.

Orphanhood, rude persecution sprees in childhood, loneliness and bitterness established the siege that could have made it difficult for him to advance, but the superior measures helped him overcome these harsher challenges and to grow inwardly towards the goal of Lighting.

Opponents of yesterday, who had reincarnated themselves too, believed him of afflictions and cruelty throughout organic existence, but he managed to love them, never returning the same barbs, the skewers and evil that directed him.

He experienced abandonment and discredit, needs of every order, countless temptations that prowling his steps threatening him with moral integrity, but did not give in to money, sex, deceptive projections of society, nor to vile feelings.

He has always remained in a climate of harmony, intune with the Generating Sources of Life, from where he would draw courage and strength not to faint. Working tirelessly, he broadened the field of solidarity, and lighting the archote of rational faith that he had through the unusual psychic testimonies, illuminated lives that have become lighthouses and support for so many other existences.

He never exalted himself and never gave himself to discouragement, not even when under the stained anniversary of perverse accusations, remaining faithful to duty, without presenting personal defenses or justifications for his acts.

Slowly, by example, by probity and the effort of christian hero, it sensitized the people and their leaders, who came to love it, became a parameter of behavior, becoming a reference person for safe information about the world spiritual and the phenomena of mediumship.

His sweet and anointed word of kindness always sounded teaching, directing and forwarding the people who sought him to the path of Good.

In continuous contact with his Guardianship Angel, he never let him down, misbehaving himself on the road of duty, maintaining discipline and fidelity to the commitment made.

Abandoned by one and the other, affections and friends, known or not, never ceased to fulfill his commitment to Life, never defecting from his tasks.

The infirmities undermined his energies, but he renewed them through prayer and the intermination exercise of charity.

The clarity of the eyes decreased until almost faded, however the inner vision became more powerful to penetrate the arcanans of Spirituality.

He never had a good time helping, but he never gave anyone a job. His homéric silences spoke louder than the disturbing discussions and foolish debates that took place around and far away from him, about the Doctrine he was marrying and his sublime teachings.

It became the largest parapsychic antenna of its time, managing to travel outside the body, when partially unfolded by natural sleep, as well as penetrating minds and hearts to better help them as much as becoming malleable to the Spirits that the used for almost seventy-five years of devoteement and renunciation in luminous mediumship. That's why yours was incomparable psychic.

... And by disembodiment, softly and sweetly, allowing the body to be quiet, ascended in the directions of infinity, being received by Jesus, who welcomed him with His goodness, asserting him:

> − Rest, for a moment, my son, in order to forget the sorrows of the earth and enjoy the ineffable joys of the kingdom of Heaven.  
Joanna of Angelas
