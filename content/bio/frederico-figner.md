Israelite of birth, lived in the paternal home the prejudices of his race against the Carpenter of Nazareth. In fact, however, Figner, like many other Jews, had no religion at all.

It was in Brazil, and when already a prosperous trader, with his commercial and industrial establishment in Rio de Janeiro and a branch in São Paulo that Figner was called to know the truth. In the last years of the last century or in the early days of this century, Figner has caught relationships of friendship with Pedro Sayão, son of the late indoctrinator Antonio Luís Sayão, father of celebrated singer Bidu Sayão. Pedro Sayão, for about two years, attended his shop and lectured on Spiritism and Christianity, without Figner being very impressed by the subject; however, in one of his visits to his establishment in São Paulo, Figner heard the painful story of an employee of his, whose wife was seriously ill and in need of sumptuous surgical intervention. Upon returning to Rio, Figner asked Pedro Sayão to obtain a recipe for healing the sick of São Paulo. The patient's prescription and cure came, without any intervention from the doctors. It was this fact that tilted Figner in favor of Spiritism.

Already impressed by the patient's cure through a psychic recipe, Figner was searched in his shop by a poor unemployed family father and in painful economic situation. He heard the account of his afflictions, gave him a little money and told him to come back eight days later. As the needy came out, for the first time in figner's life he made a request to the Carpenter of Nazareth: If it is as Christians say that You have power, help that poor father of family; get him work and livelihoods!

Eight days later, the man returned with the smile of the happy and told him: "I am already working and soon I will return his money, Mr Figner. I was approached by a person who invited me to an entirely unexpected job."

Figner was enthusiastic and repeated similar requests, with always positive results. Instead of asking Jesus, he began to ask Mary and also the results were not expected. He filled with faith that carries mountains and enthusiastically studied Spiritism and Christianity. He began to consecrate his life to the service of others.

It is not known for sure when this conversion occurred, but in 1903, traces of Figner's spiritist activities in the Brazilian Spiritist Federation are already found.

On the occasion of the Spanish flu in 1918, with 14 patients in his own home and himself sickened and feverish, he spent the entire days in the Federation, serving the sick and needy who went there, in avalanches, to seek resources for distressing situations.

His normal life for long years consisted of going to the Federation to take sayings of recipes from various mediums, taking 150 to 200 recipes a day and giving passes on numerous patients. He got up at five o'clock in the morning and, before going to the store, he went to the Federation, where he only left when he finished this service to take sayings of recipes. At four o'clock in the afternoon there i was back there to pray and pass on patients. And he really healed the sick, for his "patrons", as he called them in intimacy, always grew from numbers.

As a propagandist of the Doctrine, he always maintained a section in the Morning Mail, which was read throughout the country. In 1921, he polemized with Father Florêncio Dubois for Folha do Norte, Pará. Promoted the publication of many books, costing the editions. He went to England to visit the famous Circle of Crew, where medium Willy Hope obtained the famous photographs of extras; visited, then, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and other great figures of English Spiritism.

In 1920, he lost his firstborn daughter, and his wife became inconsolable. Hearing him speak of materialization medium D. Ana Prado, from Belém do Pará, decided to leave for the North. On April 1, 1921, he boarded with his whole family. What happened in those sessions is reported in dr. Nogueira de Faria's book, entitled The Work of the Dead, by Mrs Esther Figner, wife of Frederico Figner, who, only returning from the sessions and assisted by his daughter Leontina, wrote report minute of everything that had happened.

Frederico Figner was born in the early hours of December 2, 1866, in the humble house of No. 37, teynska street in Milevsko, near Tabor, Czechoslovakia, then Bohemia and part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

He was, therefore, a compatriot of another missionary who as he had come to fulfill his task in Brazil, during a long existence as a Brazilian, among the best, Francisco Valdomiro Lorenz, born in Zbislav, near Tcháslav, and arrived in Brazil two years after Figner. Both came from the Homeland of the great martyrs of Christianity, John Huss and Jerome of Prague, to publicize here the superior ideals that led the two heroes to the torments of the Inquisition. Figner and Lorenz gravitated to the Brazilian Spiritist Federation that was very young when they arrived in Brazil. Figner gallantly won the slippery and dangerous proof of wealth, Lorenz won with equal bravery the torments of poverty and became one of the most esperantist cults in the world, with several published works.

The son of poor parents, Figner had to immigrate to the New World, as did the young people of Central Europe at the time. At the age of thirteen, he leaves his father's home and goes to the city of Bechim to learn a trade. In 1882, at the age of 16, he left his homeland permanently. Depart with his emigrant briefcase to Bremershafen, from where, aboard the Elbe steam (as a third-class passenger), head to the United States only taking money for the crossing. Figner counted an interesting detail of this trip. His mother had made it and gave her for the trip a sweet bread braid. Arriving on board, note that third-class power is absolutely unbearable. Then divide so your sweet bread, lucky enough for all the crossing that lasted 14 days. That was your only diet for two weeks.

It carried as a model of conduct the tenacity of the parents. It was the example to imitate to win in life.

A violent storm was the only incident of the crossing, but it was rude to fight to acquire economic stability, so as to keep up and help parents and siblings. United States, Mexico, Central America and finally South America were its fields of economic struggle. In Brazil, this son of Israel found his Canaan. Established herself, prospered, met a young woman of pilgrims virtues and soul of artist, D. Esther de Freitas Reys, daughter of illustrious family.

In 1897, Frederico Figner and D. Esther de Freitas Reys founded, by marriage, their happy home. He received the award for his great struggles of thirty years, but did not dream rest, which was not ideal of his vibrant character. Six children were born from this happy bond: Rachel, Aluízio, Gabriel, disappeared from the world before the revered genitor; Leonilda, Helena and Lélia, very devoted to their old father.

Figner's service, in the work of care and in professional work, kept him away from the home, but this did not harm the cultivation of an extreme affection between father and children. They loved each other ardently and mutually respected each other's particular ideas and beliefs.

Still in the last days of his life, he distributed primarily donations to institutions and poor people of his friendship, guided by the heart and not always by the brain, and only respecting the fortuneof his daughters.

He worked and served selflessly until the illness trapped him to bed a few days before departure. He turned eighty on December 2, 1946, and on January 19, 1947, at 8 p.m., he left for the spirit world, leaving open paths of light on earth that he had stepped on for so long.

At the funeral appeared a crowd of friends and admirers. In front of the mortuary chamber, the President of the Federation uttered farewell words and the Vice President pleading. As the auúde went down to the deposit, in the Cemetery of São Francisco Xavier, drs. Miranda Ludolf, Lins de Vasconcellos and Captain Silva Pinto spoke with sentiment.

The Brazilian Spiritist Federation, after Figner's death, published some of the writings in the book entitled − Spiritist Chronicles.
