180 years ago, he reincarnated a Spirit of manure. He served as jurisconsult, magistrate, politician, journalist, literate and spiritist linked to groups that originated FEB.\r

Francisco Leite de Bittencourt Sampaio was born in Laranjeiras (Sergipe) on February 1, 1834. He was the son of Maria de Sant'Ana Leite Sampaio and the Portuguese Francisco Leite de Bittencourt Sampaio (namesake). He began his legal course at the Recife Law School, moved to São Paulo and completed him at the Law School of Largo de São Francisco in 1859. After graduation, he served as a public prosecutor for two years in his hometown and in Itabaiana, and then joined in the city of Rio de Janeiro.1 He defaced in this city on October 10, 1895.\r

Literato and journalist Stood out in his academic life for being the author of well-known lyrics by Antônio Carlos Gomes.Este, in his youth, in 1859, lived in a republic in the vicinity of the Faculty, living with the students of law. He composed the hymn, with the lyrics of Bittencourt Sampaio, which was adopted as the Hymn of the Faculty of Law.2 The first presentation to students of the Faculty of Law of São Paulo provoked ovation on the part of the young people. Here's an excerpt:\r

> Youth, hey forward, eia onwards! / That Brazil over you raises faith; This immense giant colossus / Worked for erecting it standing! Brazil wants the light of truth, / And a c'roa of laurels too, Only laws that give us freedom, / To the giant of jungles deck! Your star shines radiant, / Oh! lift it all, in faith, This immense giant colossus / Work to lift it up on your feet!\r

In our view, the cry is suitable, including for the Spiritist youth of our day. Bittencourt Sampaio and Carlos Gomes also composed, respectively, the lyrics and music of the modinha Who knows?, much reproduced to the present day. 4 This was composed of the two together in just one night.5 Author of several works in prose and verse was considered, by Sylvio Romero and João Ribeiro, the first of the Brazilian lyric authors, soon after Gonçalves Dias. Among his works deserves to highlight The divine epic of John the Evangelist.\r
It is a reproduction of the Gospel of John, in decassyllable verses, of rare beauty and grandeur.6 It has been edited by FEB since 1938.7 Books of poetry: Brazilian Harmonies (also including Macedo Soares and Salvador de Mendonça, 1859), Wild Flowers ( 1860) and Poems of slavery (1884).6\r

When he defaced his friend José Bonifácio, the Young Man, (José Bonifácio de Andrada e Silva, 1827-1886), great nephew of the "Patriarch of Independence", Bittencourt Sampaio dedicated to him the following verses:\r

> Yes! He entered, of blessings [radiant,By the gate of light of eternity, Which eagle, which, from heaven in the [immensity,Free flies, so from us far away!1\r
He collaborated in several press agencies – academics, literary and political – in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.He was known for the brilliance of his articles and respected by the elevation, sincerity and firmness with which he sustained and defended his ideals.\r
Political and administrative activities Involved with politics, joined the Liberal Party and was elected deputy to the Legislative General Assembly in the legislatures of 1864–1866 and 1867–1870. In the last period, he was president of the Province of Espírito Santo, appointed by imperial letter from September 29, 1867 to April 26, 1868.1\r

In 1870, he embraced Republican ideas. With Saldanha da Gama, Quintino Bocaiúva and others signed the famous Republican Manifesto–important historical document – of December 3, 1870. He was one of the founders of the Republican Party.1\r

After the proclamation of the Republic, he served in the Legislature to inventory the documents of the House of Representatives and as editor of the debates in the Constituent Assembly in 1890. At the same time, he was the first administrator of the National Library of Rio de Janeiro. With the retirement of the last librarian, Saldanha da Gama, and already with the new official title of director of the National Library, at the beginning of the Government of the Republic, was appointed to this position, on December 12, 1889, remaining until October 25, 1892. Education Minister Benjamin Constant signed the reform "republicanizing" the Library in 1890.8\r

Spiritist performance1 As a spiritist, he developed his mediumship as a prescription for homeopathy in the Confucius Group in Rio de Janeiro, an entity to which he belonged since August 2, 1873.1 Reports Antônio Luís Saião, in 1878:\r

> [...] Bittencourt gave medicine to the poor deceived by doctors, became him the doctor of our family, with such success that the diseases, the most insignificant as the most complicated, were always fought with the same splendid result, which was witnessed even by some doctors, our close friends.1\r

Bittencourt was a founding member of the Society of Spiritist Studies God, Christ and Charity (Rio de Janeiro, March 23, 1876), later called the Academic Society God, Christ and Charity (1879). Disgusted by the situation in this Society, on March 21, 1880, together with a group of dissidents, including Antônio Luís Saião and medium Frederico Júnior, founded the Spiritist Fraternity Society, under the presidency of João Gonçalves do Nascimento, remarkable healing medium.\r

On July 15, 1880, Antônio Luís Saião – converted to Spiritism thanks to the curative mediumship of Bittencourt Sampaio – and who had tried unsuccessfully to recompose the former Academic Society God, Christ and Charity, founded on September 24, 1885, with Frederico Junior, João Gonçalves do Nascimento, Bittencourt Sampaio and others, the Group of The Humble, better known as the Saião Group, intended for the study and practice of the Gospels. The change to the designation of Ismael Group occurred when it joined the Brazilian Spiritist Federation (founded on January 2, 1884). In this Group, Bittencourt Sampaio acted as a medium to receive beautiful and instructive messages from superior Spirits. The Group operates until today at feb's Headquarters in Rio de Janeiro. In 1891, FEB received the accession of the Spiritist Society Fraternity.1,9 In a memorable meeting held in July 1895, an authentic spiritual agreement of alliance between the three strongest currents that worked in the former Capital was concluded: the Federation, the Ismael Group and the Assistance to the Needy. Bezerra de Menezes would be the delegate of this spiritual alliance, and based on the flag "God, Christ and Charity" and the union of the three poles would be erected the temple of Spiritist Christianity in Brazil.9\r

It is clear that Bittencourt and Bezerra were contemporary and were close in the political agendas in the Liberal Party, the General Legislative Assembly and the Ismael Group. But Bittencourt's spiritist performance precedes Bezerra's in about fifteen years.\r

### The divine epic \r
In his remarkable work – cited by literatos6–, Bittencourt comments on the objectives of the book:\r

> [...] show them that not only material bread lives led me in the days sanctified to the study of the Gospels, writing now the text itself in language within everyone's reach, sometimes translating in verse what seemed to me to adapt most to the nature and rhythm of our endecasyllable. By shifting to heroic verses the Gospel according to St. John, I had no other end but to lift my spirit to God [...]. 7 Listen to the words of the Gospel,\r

[...] The good newsman, who the beloved disciple In order of Jesus dictated to men.7\r
Reference and spiritual works After his disincarnation, Bittencourt Sampaio, through medium Frederico Júnior, wrote the works Jesus before Christianity, From Jesus to children and From Calvary to revelation, edited by FEB. In the book I returned,10 the Spirit Brother Jacob, by the psychography of Francisco Cândido Xavier, in conversation in the spiritual world with Guillon Ribeiro, reveals the mission of Bittencourt Sampaio:\r
" Guillon – I exclaimed hesitantly – you know That I have always dedicated love and veneration to Bittencourt Sampaio... Where's he going to be? Can I find him? Informed me the companion that our respectable friend collaborates in the supervision of evangelical Spiritism, in a higher plan, adding, however, that probably would be Bittencourt the messenger of friendship who would come from higher bring me the welcome, in the night of my reception in the great temple.10 Since his efforts – as a denoted pioneer of Spiritism in the country – until our day, Bittencourt Sampaio is an herald of the spread of the Gospel in the light of Spiritism!\r
