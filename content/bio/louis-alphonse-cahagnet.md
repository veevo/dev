Louis Alphonse Cahagnet, considered one of the pioneers in the use of magnetism for
communicate with the dead through induced sleepwalking, reembodied in the
city of Caen, France in 1809. In Arcananos of Future Life Unveiled (1848),
Cahagnet compiles articles of its published in journals and that deal with
research on the exchange "dead and alive", presenting to the reader
important narratives of sleepwalkers, such as Adèle Maginot. This describes
the functioning of the spiritual world, its organization, and, as a correspondent
of spirits, clarifies the existence of the perispirit, explains the basics of the
magnetism and many other themes.

In 1848, the "Society of
Spiritualist magnetizers" group formed by people who participated in the
pequisas performed by Cahagnet; later it would be called "Society
of the Swedenborgian Students."
Respected in the scientific environment, we can observe how Louis Alphonse Cahagnet
contributed and benefited the research of numerous scholars of magnetism, such as
example, Michaelus in Spiritual Magnetism, Gabriel Delanne (1857-1926) in A
Alma is Immortal, Silvino Canuto de Abreu (1892-1980) in The Book of Spirits and
His
Historical and Legendary Tradition, etc.

Surely there were those who disparaged their work. Your opponents
 stated that the narrative of those sleepwalkers did not deserve credit as evidence
Material. They could be induced by the magnetizer command or a
Simple
transmission of thought. Witnesses who participated in these activities
confirmed the veracity of communications, as many of them received
personal information.

Cahagnet is said not to believe in reincarnation, for his roots in the
Catholicism were very strong, but was sure that communication with
those who are no longer with us on this side was possible and that death did not
Exists.
Disembodied in 1885 in the city of Argenteuil, France.
