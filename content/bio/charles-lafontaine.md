In 1841, watching a public demonstration of magnetism, the English doctor
James Braid, from Manchester, surprised by skills and results
achieved by magnetizer Charles Lafontaine, is interested in the subject of
causing hypnotism to arise.

It was this year that Lafontaine carried out several experiments with the aim of
prove the magnetic effects on plants. After taking a geranium that was
dying, magnetized him by being able to revive him and more, stimulating his
growth and doing so
bloom with more abundance than the other geraniums that were there
Planted. Other magnetizers, following their successes, have carried out other
experiences achieving fabulous successes with plants, not only by healing them,
as well as
making them more productive.

Born in Vendôme, France, in 1803, Charles Lafontaine participated in the second
generation of magnetizers together with Baron du Potet, Aubin Gautier,
Charpignon, Foissac, among others.

He was a great promoter of magnetism through his demonstrations
Itinerant. The audience, upon seeing him, took it by a mystical healer, a
charlatan, led by his exotic appearance to the time, a man
physically large, who always dressed in black and wore a long beard.
They convinced themselves of their potential by seeing him
act on someone, leading them to extreme insensitivity, even
when subjected to shocks or burns with candles.

In 1854, he taught courses on magnetism that were attended by people of
education and various professions and religions.
In addition, he published a newspaper entitled "Le Magnetiseur". He also wrote a
autobiography and "L'art de magnétiser", containing abstracts of his observations.

He died in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1892.
