João Nunes Maia was born on November 10, 1923, in Glaucilândia, formerLy
Juramento, north of Minas Gerais. Mediumship came to light early, bringing
anguish and afflictions. The support came from her mother, Mrs. Maria Nunes, who
clinging to prayers. Young Nunes studied and fought, developing psychography,
psychophonia, clairvoyance and unfolding.  João Nunes died on 04/09/1991. He
left on Earth the continuation of his ideals through the Spiritist Society Maria
Nunes. Long way, but with happy ending.\r

Her father, Joaquim da Silva Maia and his mother, Maria Nunes Maia, had five
children. They had no information about the Spiritist Doctrine. The couple's
second child, João Nunes Maia (Joaquim Maia had eight more children from the
second marriage) talked alone and was regarded as "strange". Looking for the
balance they went after Mrs. Lozinha, known as the region's benzedeira: she had
a resource for bad eye, anemia, for pests that attacked the farms.\r

Nunes went on to attend the meetings at The Far House of Mrs. Lozinha, where he
went on horseback. Mediunized, she warned him about her future tasks and the
need to know the works of Allan Kardec. Through the postal refund, the medium
orders the Brazilian Spiritist Federation the basic books of the Doctrine. Books
in hand, travels to Brejinho Farm, where he studies for almost a year. At this
time, it creates the habit of talking to God, at sunrise and sunset and, one
morning, has the inspiration that would guide the Spiritist Society Maria Nunes:
the motto of Bread and book. Encouraged by his father, and already orphaned as a
mother, he moved to Belo Horizonte in 1950, being welcomed by his friend Chico
Sapateiro who teaches him the craft. Later, he will live in a slum, in the Santa
Tereza neighborhood. After marriage to Irene, he moves into a house in the same
neighborhood. The union with Irene gave him two daughters: one of them Alcione;
the other did not come to be born.\r

João Nunes attends spiritist meetings and meets, in Pedro Leopoldo, medium
Francisco Cândido Xavier, of whom he becomes friends. In a mediumistic meeting
at the Spiritist Union of Minas Gerais, he identifies himself with the Spirit of
Fernando Miramez de Olivídeo, his spiritual guide and author of several books
psychographed by Nunes, being the first Some Angles of teachings of the Master.
In the silence characteristic of his personality, João Nunes did much for the
spiritist movement. He encouraged, guided and participated in the foundation of
several spiritist houses in Belo Horizonte, Minas gerais and other Brazilian
states. Seeking to disseminate the Doctrine, João Nunes Maia created the
National Campaign of the Free Spiritist Book in 1958, traveling by truck through
distant regions of Brazil. In 1973, through the Mesmer Spirit, he received the
formula of the Grandpa Peter Ointment, which cures skin evils.\r

As a result of its persistence, the Spiritist Society Maria Nunes - SEMAN
appears on April 12, 1955. Started with evangelical-doctrinal studies and humble
distribution of soup to the needy, SEMAN branched into various social activities
and allowed, through Editora Fonte Viva, his partner, the edition of 62
psychographed books.\r

The originals psychographed by João Nunes Maia, which were kept under the bed,
in the modest house of Santa Tereza, became books. They spread throughout
Brazil, Portugal, the United States, Spain, Japan and God knows where else.
Mission accomplished, disembodies on 4 September 1991 the boy John of
Glaucilândia. Journey like the path that led you to Mrs. Lozinha.\r

He personally guided hundreds of unbalanced mediums. He psychographed the
greatest spiritist work that supports the understanding of basic works. There
are 20 volumes of the Spiritist Philosophy collection. He worked hard for
spiritist institutions to put in a prominent form on the frontispiece of their
homes, spiritist qualification. Participated in the creation of the 1st
Spiritist program in Radio belo horizonte. He guided and conducted the
transformation, in Belo Horizonte, of umbandista center in Spiritist Center. He

(10,000 volumes) of "The Gospel According to Spiritism", feb. He held the 1st
Spiritist Book Of Belo Horizonte. He founded the Bookstore of the Spiritist
Union of Minas Gerais, at request and with the guidance of Francisco Cândido
Xavier. He was a board member of the Spiritist Hospital André Luiz. He was a
