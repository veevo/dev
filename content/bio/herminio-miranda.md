Hermínio Corrêa de Miranda (Volta Redonda, January 5, 1920) was a Brazilian
spiritist researcher and writer. He usually signed Herminio C.  Miranda.

Graduated in Accounting Sciences, having worked at Companhia Siderúrgica
National until he retires.

His first book, Dialogue with Shadows, was published in 1976. After came many
other titles, and their copyright supputes were always ceded to philanthropic
institutions.

One of the most read spiritist writers today, also a translator, Hermínio Correa
de Miranda, born in 1920, took a breath for research and readings so broad that
it would not be at all wrong to state that he was the writer of the Writers.
Perhaps in this respect and to some extent Ernesto was equated Mr. Bozzano. In
his work, extensive and also dense, the references bibliographic, alongside
their thematic preferences and a concern constant with the conceptualizations,
which wishes to make clear for better expression of his thought.

Contributed to this the competent ability to read in several languages and a
privileged memory that Miranda demonstrated to possess, valuing greatly his
self-taught.

Having resided for some time in the United States, on professional service,
improved there not only his knowledge of English but also the taste for profuse
literature of the country of Uncle Sam, in particular the works related to the
themes of your choice.

Miranda was not a researcher of the type Ian Stevensson or Hernani Guimarães
Andrade. While these worry about the analysis of the facts in their details
commendable, when it comes to miranda's reincarnation if it was usually worth
biographical research with support in consistent bibliography, in which they are
present, including, works of history. It's quite true that your book more dense
on the subject -- "I am Camille Desmoulins" -- written in partnership with the
sujet of the research, Luciano dos Anjos, has another type of support: the
memory regression. It is also true that using the experiences regression of
memory in other works on reincarnation. your argumentation, however, favored the
comparison of biographical data, in the that was rigorous if so we can express
ourselves.

Miranda's seriousness, in this as in other works, is undeniable. Running the
risk of being challenged, he advanced in defending his own ideas in some
innovating otherwise in the originality of the matter at least in the use of new
designations for known facts, as is the case with your "replay", name which
attributes to the phenomenon observed by Ernesto Bozzano in "The Crisis of
Death", the respect for the memories that the individual passes on at the moment
of disincarnation.

His thought was that "the historian or historigrapher should not imagine
non-existent facts to fill gaps or justify the "your" philosophy of Story. It
should be limited to narrating the facts, as presented in the documentation or
in the best and most credible tradition."

Beside her abundant production in line with reincarnation, Miranda was revealed
to be also interested in the psychic facts, privileged that it was by the
coexistence with some fertile mediums in analysis material. Your ability to
record the information obtained by this route, as well as to expand it with
bibliographic research, allowed him to write numerous books, in a relationship
that the series Stories that spirits have told emerge. In these works surprises
the fact that the author works with memory regression in spirits Protesters.

This intimate relationship with the invisible plan, which the author says lasted
some decades in an environment separated from the spiritist center, firstd out a
"When the task began, the concept I formulated about the spirits was that of the
books he had studied during the period of instruction and Training. For me, they
would be entities that, in a way, transcended the human condition, almost as
living abstractions, situated in a dimension that my senses did not reach. But
it was none of that, spirits are people like the People! They suffer, love,
laugh and cry. They experience afflictions, discouraged, joys, hopes, all the
same."

Still on the plane of successive lives, Miranda believed to be the reincarnation
of one of Martin Luther's faithful collaborators at the time of the Reformation,
having to this personality an unusual admiration. Your studies on previous lives
include Luther (this would be paul's reincarnation). This might explain, among
other things, Miranda's also great interest in theology and, in Christianity,
and it is worth highlighting there the two volumes of The Marks of the Christ
and still Christianity: The Forgotten Message.

It cannot therefore fail to mention at this point two things: being the study of
theology, Miranda was not a common-type mystic; nevertheless, he was frankly
partisan of the religious aspect of Spiritism, revealing one of the few moments
of his work in which it is blunt: "The Spiritism is consistent with this
immortal message, and therefore has implemented so solidly on the foundation of
three "pilotis": science, philosophy and Religion. Today, examining the facts
from the privileged point of view of perspective, we know that religious support
is the most important of the three." It follows, therefore, the Emanuelina line,
in which it was not content only to point out his vision, but highlighted what
he understands to be the primordial aspect: the religious.  Beres, he confirms
it: "Spiritism ... is ultimately summarized in a clear and objective proposal
for evolutionary personal effort to replace salvationist, dogmatic and
irrational religions. Rationalized faith, purified and sustained by
experimentation, remains faith, more than Never. If this is not religion, what
would it be, after all?"

## Curious aspects in Herminio Miranda
1. He was not a writer who could say popular. While in some
moments demonstrate intentions in this direction, his language betrays him, his style
was dense and bear a seriousness of the kind that is not allowed, mild that
are, a few hints of jocularity. Sometimes he tried, but he didn't succeed.
Therefore, it would be interesting to analyze the reason for the excellent sale of their
books;

2. Miranda abused the conceptualities and clarifications based on the
dictionaries and encyclopedias. You have the impression that you wrote with "Aurelius"
and the "British" next door, to them constantly resorting. This can
mean, for example, a tendency to didacticism, while
concerned about the final product of the reader's reception;

3. There was also an almost excessive concern in it of convincing the
reader who did not wish to modify his opinion of certain
aspects especially linked to belief. When analyzing the whole of his work,
this fact stands out with some sharpness, contrasting with the firmness with which
defends their opinions.

He died on 8 July 2013 at the age of 93.
