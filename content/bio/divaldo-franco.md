## Origin \r
Of humble origin, Divaldo Pereira Franco was born on May 5, 1927, in the city of Feira de Santana, Bahia. Son of Francisco Pereira Franco and Ana Alves Franco (disembodied), since childhood, communicates with the Spirits. He attended the Normal Rural School of Feira de Santana, receiving a primary teacher's degree in 1943.\r

As a young man, he was shaken by the death of his older brother, which left him traumatized and sick. Several medical specialists were consulted, without obtaining any satisfactory results. It was the helping hand of Mrs. Ana Ribeiro Borges who led him to the Spiritist Doctrine, freeing him from trauma and bringing consolation to both him and his whole family.\r

## Childhood and youth \r
As a child, the sincere friendship of a little Spirit rejoiced even more his days. It was the Jaguaraçu Indian, which means,"Big Ounce." He came to play with Divaldo in the backyard of his house every day. The Indian appeared to be about five. The two little friends played without realizing the hours went by. They went up in trees, ran through the yard, set up beautiful nativity and the time of Christmas. They harvested mosses and foliage to adorn the lapinhas, as the nativity and the nativity places were called.\r

At the age of 18, in 1945, Divaldo moved to Salvador, being approved in the contest for IPASE (Institute of Social Security and Assistance of State Servers), where he joined on November 5, 1945.\r

## Mediumship and work \r
Spiritist convinced, founded the Spiritist Center Caminho da Redemption on September 7, 1947. Two years later he began his psychographing task. Several messages were written through him. Under the guidance of the Spiritual Benefactors he kept what he wrote, until one day he received the recommendation that he burn everything he had written there, because he was nothing but a simple exercise.\r

With the continuation came new messages signed by several Spirits, among them , [Joanna de Ângelis](/bio/joanna-de-angelis), which for a long time presented itself as "a Friendly Spirit", hiding in anonymity waiting for the opportune moment to present. Joanna revealed herself as her spiritual advisor, writing numerous messages, in a pleasant style passed on with deep wisdom and infinite love, which comforts people in need of spiritual guideline.\r

In 1964, [Joanna de Ângelis](/bio/joanna-de-angelis) selected several messages of his own and feissed them in the book Messe de Amor, which became divaldo's first psychographed book. Currently, the medium is a record holder and has 175 published titles, including the biographies that portray his life and work.\r

## Presence at the UN \r
At the invitation of the UN, Divaldo Franco attended the 1st World Peace Meeting, from August 28 to 31, 2000, in a summit meeting with religious leaders from around the world, an unprecedented fact in human history, to debate and produce a proposal for peace.\r
Most wars in the history of mankind were caused by religious, thirsty for supremacy and sectarian power, as politicians failed in the task of building peace between nations. A meeting of unarmed religious could produce a peace proposal for humanity through a unity of thought.\r
If there is unity of thought among the 4 billion and 800 million religious worldwide, we can end wars, since they are provoked by intolerant and psychopaths, who stimulate revenge and hatred.\r

The World Peace Meeting has already produced results:\r
1. Creation of the Religious for Peace segment at the UN summit, which will work with political delegates aimed at achieving peace on the Planet by 2021.\r
2. Preparation of a document with suggestions and proposals forwarded to all the governments of the Earth, in which stands out the importance of universal disarmament of all artifacts, including bacteriological and chemical.\r
749 delegates from 73 countries attended the alluded Meeting, a total of 3,000 representatives, including Buddhism, Hinduism, Shinto, Masdeism and the high hierarchy of the Russian Catholic and Orthodox Churches.\r

## Proposals for peace \r
We can work for peace if we face the four themes chosen, which Divaldo Franco compares and complements with the teachings of Allan Kardec, contained in The Spirits Book.\r

### 1 − Peace in itself \r
When he knows how to take advantage of all the resources of his intelligence and when he knows how to take care of his personal conservation, he combines the feeling of a true charity for his fellow men.\r

### 2nd − Working to end poverty \r
In a society where someone starves, we should be ashamed to live in it.\r

### 3 − Respect for the environment \r
The Earth is our mother and this world, today of trials and atonements, will yield to the world of regeneration.\r

### 4 − Forgiveness and reconciliation \r
The peaceful man is not vengeful. Like Jesus, forgive the offenses so as not to remember the benefits, because he knows that he will be forgiven as he himself has forgiven.\r

### Divaldo's Considerations \r
Divaldo Franco considered the meeting exciting, mainly because it was a significant global gathering of religious leaders who, for the first time in history, were not fighting. Buddhists alongside Hindus, Islamists, indigenous peoples from Africa, North America, Brazilian Pataxo and Caetés Indians, Guatemalans etc. The 15 most representative religions on Earth and also Spiritism participated, catalogued as a religion with the same rights as others, in a universe of 1 billion Hindus, 1 billion and 200 million Christians and 600 million Islamists and Muslims.\r

## Simplicity \r
Divaldo Franco recognizes himself only as a servant of the Spiritist Cause, despite having been given to him by the promoters of the event the title of religious leader. As a publicist of the Spiritist Doctrine and medium, there he was discreet, as recommended by Kardequian thought.\r

### Joanna de Angela's Considerations \r
In addressing his religion, a Jewish leader stated that to be respected his belief, he should respect other religions, since he was not the only one. At that moment, [Joanna de Ângelis](/bio/joanna-de-angelis), paraphrasing a parable, told the medium: God took from an immense mirror in which He was reflected and threw it to Earth. When hitting the ground, it fragmented into a thousand pieces. Every creature on earth, upon taking a piece, was left with a fragment that reflects God, but no one has achieved full possession, which is why God reveals himself proportionally to the level of consciousness and intelligence of each. So are religions: they take care of partially revealing God, without doing so in its entirety.\r

### The choice of theme \r
Divaldo Franco chose poverty because he wanted to know the solutions to the proposals. He made use of the tribune, explained the bases of Spiritism and stressed: \r

> This meeting proves that the Spiritist Doctrine has the same proposals presented here and that man's great enemy is still selfishness. The favorite son of selfishness is ignorance, which surrounds creatures in shadows. He cited Allan Kardec, who advocated moral education to end poverty in the world and not just conventional education.\r
