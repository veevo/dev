Gabriel Delanne (along with Léon Denis) marks the transition of 19th-century
Spiritism, influenced by Kardec's presence, to Spiritism of the early 20th
century, seeking his scientific affirmation, trying to excite men of science of
the time. \r

Born in Paris on March 23, 1857, in the same year as the publication of The Book
of Spirits, Delanne was (together with Léon Denis) the closest disciple of Allan
Kardec. \r

In addition, he was probably the first great spiritist character born in a
Spiritist family. Just to remember, Allan Kardec became aware of spiritist
phenomena at the age of 50 and Léon Denis was a teenager when he first heard of
Spiritism. Gabriel Delanne was born into a Spiritist family. His father,
Alexandre Delanne, closely followed the work of Allan Kardec, having formed a
small family group of Spiritist studies and as a scribe medium his wife (and
Gabriel's mother) Alexandrine Delanne.\r Therefore, since childhood Gabriel
Delanne was familiar with the spiritist vocabulary and attended, from a very
young age, to numerous spiritist sessions. Delanne even caught contact with
Master Kardec in his childhood – Kardec died when Delanne was 12 years old.\r

## A troubled and suffering life \r
Gabriel Delanne began his studies at Cluny High School (in Saone-et-Loire), then at grau college (in Haute-Soane) and, at the age of 19, joined the Central School of Arts and Manufacturing. As his parents' financial situation did not allow the completion of his studies, he began working at the Popp Compressed Air and Electricity Company, where he was until 1892, dividing his time between his work and his dedication to Spiritism.\r

Delanne didn't enjoy good health. As a boy he had an abscess in his left eye – for which he was exempt from military service – which resulted in an infection that would progressively impair his vision. Over the years his state of health was worsening. In 1906, paralysis of the lower limbs forced him to walk with two canes. Not so he abandoned the conferences in France and abroad, always disseminating spiritist ideas. In the period of The First War (1914/18), Delanne's health worsened even more. Each movement was a great suffering and on top of that went blind. In 1918, I could no longer walk and the use of a wheelchair was needed. Despite all the physical sufferings, he continued to produce incessantly, withdrawn in the village of Montmorency, where Jean Myer had given him asylum.\r

His death occurred on February 15, 1926, at the age of 69. His grave is in the famous Parisian cemetery of Pere Lachaise.\r

## Contributions to Spiritism \r
Gabriel Delanne marked the transition and continuation of Kardec's work. A staunch defender of the scientific character of the Spiritist Doctrine, he dedicated most of his efforts in the struggle to consolidate Spiritism as an established and complementary science to others. He was president of the French Spiritist Union, president of the Society of Studies of Psychic Phenomena, founder and director of the Scientific and Moral Journal of Spiritism. Writer of great talent, among his main works, stand out:\r

Spiritism Before Science; The Spiritist Phenomenon; Animic Evolution; Reincarnation; The Soul is Immortal; Katie King; The Materializations of Vila Carmem\r

They mark their works the fierce defense of spiritist concepts and the fight against materialism. Using the rational method employed at the time, he uses cases and observations to prove his hypotheses. Despite accepting the revelation of spirits, he has always sought proof through the facts.\r

Certainly, his greatest contribution to Spiritism was the thesis of the perispirit. If the perispirit concept had been introduced by Allan Kardec, it was Delanne who defined it, studied and attributed various functions in body and spiritual economy. Vitalist, he attributes to the perispirit the answer to the outstanding questions of his time:\r

How to explain life? Why do you die? How is organic stability maintained in the face of constant cellular renewal? How to explain the intelligent action of the soul on the body? Where is memory located? How do animic evolution occur?\r

For all these questions Delanne offered as an answer the existence of the perispirit, its characteristics and functions. In addition, he developed a brilliant explanation about spiritist phenomena, again using the perispirit as a centerpiece, always emphasizing that Spiritism had nothing supernatural and was based on natural bases, that is, in the existence of this physical body, however ethereal, bridge between the soul and the physical body. It also introduced with great force the notion of vital fluid. Finally, he attributed to the perispirit the thirst for memory, thus establishing a link between reincarnation and animic evolution.\r

In a way, all scientific development attempted by several Spiritist authors, such as André Luiz and Hernani G. Andrade, is based on Delanne's postulates. It must be accepted that the progress of science demonstrated that Several of Delanne's hypotheses were incorrect; however, it is remarkable the effort made by him to put Spiritism par with science, not only by the method employed, but by the constant search for facts that prove his propositions.\r

The reading of his works shows a passionate Delanne, convinced of the strength of spiritist ideas and, more than anything, aware of the moral impact of these, as attests to us the following excerpt of the conclusion of his work The Anic Evolution (FEB):\r

With the certainty of successive lives and the responsibility of our acts, many problems will prove to be under new prisms. The social struggles, which affect, in our time, a character of acute roughness, can be softened by the conviction that it is not planetary existence more than a transitory moment in the course of an eternal evolution.\r

With less pride in the upper layers and less envy in the lows, effective solidarity will arise, in contact with these comforting doctrines, and perhaps we can see the fratricide struggles, inept fruits of ignorance, dissipate from the face of the earth, to dissipate before the teachings of love and brotherhood, which are the radiosa crown of Spiritism.\r

For all his dedication to the Spiritist idea, in defense of the scientific aspect of Spiritism and for his humanism, Gabriel Delanne deserves a prominent place among the thinkers who contributed to the evolution of the Spiritist idea in the twentieth century.\r
