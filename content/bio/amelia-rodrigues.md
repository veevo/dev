Poet, educator and writer disembodied in 1926, continues to write\r
incessantly as a spirit. Thus, it provides us with poetry of a\r
immeasurable beauty, books that narrate events from the time of Jesus and\r
lessons based on His teachings.\r

Amelia Augusta do Sacramento Rodrigues was born on May 26, 1861 at the Treasury\r
Campos, located in Parish of Oliveira dos Campinhos, Municipality of Santo\r
Amaro da Purificação, State of Bahia. While incarnate was a remarkable\r
poet, emeritus teacher, consecrated writer and theatristologist, i.e. a\r
legitimate cultural exponent of the Letters of Bahia.\r

Since his childhood he has already shown his high spiritual condition, having begun\r
writing poetry at the age of 12. In 1891, thanks to its ability to teach\r
and to his love for the cause of teaching, was transferred to Salvador and crowded in the\r
Central School of The Santo Antônio Neighborhood. One of his students, teenager yet,\r
in 1905, he was selected to teach English by the philosopher Spencer's system.\r
Amelia Rodrigues not only helped him understand that philosopher's thinking,\r
how he complemented his learning. I told him, "The young man needs education\r
which is the fundamental principle of social discipline; without appealing to the\r
heart, to educate is to form in man the most enduring forces of the social order." The\r
amelia rodrigues' thought identifies with Fénelon's thinking,\r
"The Gospel According to Spiritism": "To educate is to train men of Good,\r
and not just instruct them." Retired, she did not give up her ideal of teaching.\r

He returned to the magisterium in an even more remarkable way. Founded the Institute\r
Maternal Mary Help of Christians, who later became the "Action of\r
Exposed." She dedicated herself to journalism as a collaborator of the publications\r
religious "The Messenger of Faith", "The Paladina" and "The Voice". Wrote some pieces\r
theaters, including "Fausta" and "The Nativity". She is the author of the poems\r
"Religious Clarisse" and "Well you want me." In addition to clearly showing your\r
abolitionist ideology, also produced didactic works, children's literature and\r
Novels. He defaced salvador on August 22, 1926.\r

In the Spiritual Plan, he continued his enlightening and educational work, based on\r
in the Gospel of Jesus, an inspiring source of his works when incarnated.\r
Found in Spirituality – infinite seara of immortality – greater expansion\r
for his thirsty spirit of knowledge and hungry for love, giving vent to the\r
nobler longings. It deepened in the message of Jesus and, at present,\r
participates in the phalanx of Joanna de ngelis, mentor of Divaldo Pereira Franco.\r
By the psychography of the selfless worker, has been bringing pages of beauty\r
that address the most varied subjects about the Gospel, its theme\r
favorite, from where he draws uplifting lessons for those who are tired and\r
burdened, in need of guidance and comfort.\r
