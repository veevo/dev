Sebastião Lasneau was born in Barra do Piraí, a small town in the Paraíba Valley, in the State of Rio de Janeiro, on November 12, 1900, as the son of Evilásio Antônio Lasneau and Etelvina Santos Lasneau. He defaced in the same city on March 30, 1969.\r

Poor boy, little Sebastian began working very early in humble activities in Paracambi and Mendes, cities in the interior of Rio de Janeiro, until he was admitted as an employee of the Central Railway of Brazil, where he remained for twenty years, retiring disability. On that occasion, he worked as a cabin at Sant ́Ana da Barra Station.\r

After retirement and already convinced spiritist, he completely lost his vision, a consequence of eye disease (glaucoma). Diabetic, she also suffered from the liver and experienced lancinant pain caused by persistent polynevitis.  He unsuccessfully resorted to the help of medicine. Despite physical suffering, he remained conscious and resigned acceptance, comforted by the logic of the Spiritist Doctrine, which teaches that there is no effect without cause.\r

He always prayed, pleading for strength to resist the tough test to which he was subjected, without forgetting the actions of good.  That's when confreres of Belo Horizonte advised him to go to the city of Caratinga, Minas Gerais. There arriving, he was led to the Eureka Farm, in the municipality of Itaomi, where the Joseph Gleber Fraternity Group operated, founded by Jerry Labbale and companions of the capital of Minas Gerais, including Fábio Machado, Jair Soares, Jarbas Franco de Paula, Lídio Henriques and Ênio Wendling. In its wide-ranging facilities, inaugurated in January 1952, there were remarkable meetings with medium Antônio Sales, through whose ectoplasmic faculty, Spirits were materialized that carried out carriers of various diseases. Lasneau, subjected to the action of these generous spirits, could finally be relieved of their pain. He did not regain his vision, but he was free from the uncomfortable pains he felt in the eyeball.\r

Sebastião Lasneau was a poet, repentist and trocadilhista; made impromptu verses and any reason suggested a theme to him. Besides being a poet, he was an excellent exhibitor of doctrinal themes of Spiritism, having performed an appreciable task in the field of doctrinal dissemination. He gave a large number of lectures in spiritist institutions in the State of Rio de Janeiro and other units of the Federation, notably Minas Gerais.  He always took advantage of the journey of his travels to elaborate exquisite comics, with gospel and doctrinal themes, in order to toast the listening audience.\r

He visited his friend Francisco Cândido Xavier very often, attending meetings in Pedro Leopoldo and Uberaba. When in Belo Horizonte, he encouraged the Youth Spiritist Movement, attending the events of the few Spiritist youthcities, then existing, among them, to Maria João de Deus, Nina Arueira and O Precursor. He composed verses and melody for the hymns of the first two associations mentioned above, and only the verses for the anthem of the latter, verses musicalized by Maria Philomena Aluotto Berutto, who would later occupy the presidency of the Federative Mineira.\r

Married, in first nuptials, to Augusta Dias Lasneau, with her lived for seven years, unexpectedly enviudwith two children at an early age. Some time later, olivia Lasneau, who became a caring mother to her children and devoted wife for thirty-six years, took off.\r

None of his biographers register when he became adept at Spiritism. It is undeniable, however, to have received influence from his concunhado, the also poet Alfredo Nora, convinced spiritist, servant, like him, from Central Brazil, and disembodied in 1948. To him, dedicated Nora, through Chico Xavier, two sonnets in heptassyllable verses, with the title of Light Letter, preceded by this explanatory court: My Lasneau, is no ticket, / It is neither craft nor minutes, / It is the heart that unata / My sorrows in a reminder. This poem was psychographed on July 2, 1960, in Uberaba, and Lasneau was present. It was later included in the book Parnaso from Beyond Tomb. What is certain is that, in 1944, he joined the social framework of the Spiritist Guild of Beneficência, barra do Piraí, an institution to which he dedicated most of his life.\r

He published, with enormous difficulty, some books of his own, among which: Sunset, Verses for Eva Musa, Verses for Youth, Poems of Barra do Piraí, Cancioneiros da Fraternity, Almas que Sing.\r

Lasneau also dedicated himself to journalism, being a writer for several newspapers, including the People's Journal, barra do Piraí. He wrote chronicles and poetry, as can be seen in the editions of the newspaper, referring to the year 1941.  Honorary citizen of the city of Guarani, MG, after his disincarnation, as posthumous tribute was elected Patron of the Circle of Friends Missivistas, fraternal movement that promotes correspondence between free people and incarcerated people, throughout Brazil.\r

Lasneau was, in fact, one of the great figures of Brazilian spiritists, whose work had by setting numerous Brazilian cities, where it was present, through effective and constant participation, thus becoming a beloved personality and requested by All.\r
