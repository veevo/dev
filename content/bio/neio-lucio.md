Author of some books of Chico Xavier's psychography among them Message of the
little dead; Christian dawn; Jesus in the Home; Life speaks I, II and III; Light
sowing; Peace seed; Harvest of good and numerous messages scattered throughout
other works. 

It is the same personality as Cneius Lucius, from the novel "50 years later",
and Jaques Duchesne Davenport, of the novel "Renunciation", on whom we find the
affectionate reference of Emmanuel, psychographed in December 14, 1949 by Chico,
and which constitutes the spiritual preface to the book "Sowing of light". 

See references to Neio Lúcio in an introduction by Geraldo Lemos Neto to this
book.  In his last existence he was a teacher and was called Arthur Joviano;
then he explains why he used Neio Lúcio to autograph the books of his mining by
the mediumship of Francisco C. Xavier: 

> "For more than ten years I have observed the attitude of ours in order to
> check if Professor Joviano 
could move on, with the desired unhaunted in the fight, but after two glosss of
meditation and silent effort, I concluded that the mining teacher should not
survive, at least for now, in the circles of the infant-juvenile mind of our
home country. 

> But Neio Lúcio could dispute this position as a co-worker and, with the grace
> of Jesus, I achieved my goal!"
