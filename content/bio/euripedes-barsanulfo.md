Born on May 1, 1880, in the small town of Sacramento, State of Minas Gerais, and disembodied in the same city, at the age of 38, on November 1, 1918.\r

Soon, deep intelligence and sense of responsibility manifested itself, a collection naturally conquered in the experiences of past lives.\r

He was still very young, but very studious and with tendencies for teaching and, therefore, was tasked by his master-school to teach his own classmates. Respectable political representative of his community, he became secretary of the Brotherhood of St. Vincent de Paula, having actively participated in the foundation of the journal Gazeta de Sacramento and sacramentano high school. Soon he was squeaking to the natural position of leader, for his safe guidance on the true values of life.\r

Through information provided by one of his uncles, he became aware of the existence of spiritist phenomena and the works of the Kardequian Codification. In the face of the facts, he returned his activities entirely to the new Doctrine, researching in all means and ways, until he completely undos his doubts.\r

Awakened and convinced, he became without delay and without fading, identifying himself fully with the new ideals, a sincere and own attitude of his personality. He then sought the vicar of the mother church where he provided his collaboration, making available to him as secretary of the Brotherhood.\r

This event resonated loudly among the inhabitants of the city and among members of his own family. In a few days he began to suffer the consequences of his misunderstood attitude.\r

He persisted teaching and among the subjects included the teaching of Spiritism, provoking reaction in many people in the city, being sought by the parents of the students, who came to offer him money to return to the new subject and, in the face of his refusal, the students were removed one by one.\r

Under pressure of every order and merciless persecution, Euripides suffered severe trauma, withdrawing for treatment and recovery in a neighboring city, at which time they blossomed several mediumistic faculties, especially healing, awakening him to the missionary life. One of the first cases of healing occurred precisely with her own mother who, re-established, became a valuable advisor in her work.\r

The production of various phenomena caused hundreds of people from other stops to Sacramento, sheltering in hotels, pensions and even family homes, because all Barsanulfo attended and no one left for some benefit, at least the lenitive of faith and renewed hope and, when deserved, the benefit of healing through kind Spiritual Benefactors.\r

He assisted everyone, without distinction of class, creed or color, and where his presence was necessary, there he was, there were or not material conditions.\r

He never faded and humbly followed his path full of mishaps, but excited by the most vivid idealism. He soon felt the need to publicize Spiritism, increasing the number of his followers. For this purpose he founded the Spiritist Group Hope and Charity, in 1905, a task in which he was supported by his brothers and some friends, going on to develop interesting works, both in the doctrinal field and in social assistance activities.\r

On one occasion, he fell into a trance among the students during a class. Returning to you, he described the meeting in Versailles, France, shortly after World War I, giving the names of the participants and the exact time of the meeting when the famous treaty was signed.\r

On April 1, 1907, he founded Allan Kardec College, which became a true milestone in the field of teaching. This educational institute came to be known throughout Brazil, having worked uninterruptedly since its inauguration, with an average of 100 to 200 students, until October 18, when it was forced to lock its doors for some time, due to the great epidemic of Spanish flu that ravaged our country.\r

His work became so known that when enrollment was opened for enrollment, they ended on the same day, such was the search for students, forcing a college from the same region, run by nuns of the Order of St. Francis, to end their activities by lack of regulars.\r

Led by strong pulse, with safe guideline, the spiritist movement was strengthened in the region and this fact greatly bothered the Catholic clergy, passing this, initially veiled and, soon after, reportedly, to develop a defamatory campaign involving the worthy missionary and the doctrine of liberation, which was gallantly defended by Euripides, through the columns of the newspaper Lever, speaking mainly on the theme:God is not Jesus and Jesus is not God, with marked argumentation and undeniable, determining the defeat of his opponents who, in front of a giant who did not know fading in the fight, sent coming from Campinas, State of S. Paulo, reverend Feliciano Yague, famous for his preaching and knowledge, convinced that with his arguments and convictions they would inflict the ultimate blow into Spiritism.\r

This is how the priest challenged Euripides to a controversy in the public square. This was accepted and combined in terms respected by the well-known apostle of good.\r

On the marked day, the priest began his remarks, insulting Spiritism and spiritists, "doctrine of the devil and his adherents, madmen susceptible to eternal punishment", in a demonstration of false religious zeal, thus giving public witness to hatred, showing his soul full of intolerance and sectarianism.\r

The crowd that remained respectful and confident in the replica of the defender of Spiritism, anticipated the defeat of the offenders, by the very fragility of their empty and inconsistent arguments.\r

The sublime missionary serenely waited for his opportunity, starting his part with a sincere, humble and beautiful prayer, begging for peace and tranquility for one and light to others, making the environment conducive to inspiration and assistance of the larger plan and, in then began to defend the principles on which his teachings were founded.\r

With delicacy, with logic, giving vent to his intelligence, discourted the doctrinal distortions proclaimed by the Reverend, reducing them to the insignificance of his parsimonious knowledge, corroborated by the joyful and noisy manifestation of the crowd that from the beginning he trusted that which easily demonstrated the logic of the teachings proclaimed by Spiritism.\r

At the end of the famous controversy and recognizing the Reverend's state of soul, Euripides approached him and embraced him fraternally and sincerely, as sincere were his thoughts and attitudes.\r

Barsanulfo followed with dedication the maxims of Jesus Christ until the last moment of his terrena life, on the occasion of the terrifying flu epidemic that ravaged the world in 1918, reaped lives, spreading tears and affliction, redoubling the work of the great missionary, that predicted it long before it invaded the American continent, always speaking of the gravity of the situation it would entail.\r

Manifested on our continent, came to meet him at the head of his sick, helping hundreds of poor families. He had reached the end of his fraternal mission. Exhausted by the effort spent, he defaced on November 1, 1918, at 6 p.m., surrounded by relatives, friends and disciples.\r

Sacrament in weight, in true pilgrimage, accompanied his body to the grave, feeling that he resurfaced for a higher and more sublime life.\r
