He was born on November 6, 1835, in Verona, Italy. He defaced on 19 October 1909 in Turin, Italy.\r

A scientist universally known for the important works carried out in the legal field, from an early age, devoted himself to the letters.\r

At the age of twelve, he wrote the work entitled Greatness and Decay of Rome, which had great repercussion on the intellectual media of that time.\r

About Mazolo's work, a great Italian psychologist, wrote an article, which was published in one of the Italian newspapers. Mazolo read this article and invited Lombroso to come to his house, because he wanted to meet the new writer. In front of the boy, who was only fourteen years old, he was surprised, given his early intelligence.\r

Lombroso converted to Spiritism after having carried out experiments on the mediumship of Eusarpia Paladino, which had been presented to him by Professor Chiaia of Naples.\r

In one of the sessions with this medium, he attended the materialization of the Spirit of his own mother.\r

From then on, Lombroso had no doubts about the survival and communicability of spirits.\r

He wrote several works, both in the field of Medicine and in philosophy.\r

Among them, we highlight the remarkable monograph Anthropology Criminal, The Delinquent Man, in addition to others on psychology and psychiatry.\r

About Spiritism, we can not fail to mention the Research On Hypnotic and Spiritist Phenomena, through which he reports all the experiences carried out, not only with Eusarpia Paladino, but also with other mediums of physical effects, such as Elizabeth D'Esperance and Politi.\r

Lombroso was one of the greatest criminal doctors of the last century. He graduated in Medicine in Pavia in 1858, where he received great influence from the anatomist Panizza. One year after graduating from medical school, he obtained a surgery degree in Genoa. He improved his knowledge in Vienna with the clinician Skoda and, in Padua, with the doctor Paolo Marzolo, whose positivist training would exert a profound influence on him.\r

At the age of twenty, with Cardano's Madness, Lombroso already outlines the subjects that will make him famous: the contrast between the genius of man and theories about degenerative nature. As a medical officer he writes in 1859,Memory on wounds and Amputations by Firearms, still considered one of the most original works in the Italian medical literature. It is then attracted in Calabria by the anthropological and ethnic problems of the region.\r

In 1862, in Pavia, he began a psychiatric course and, the following year, he became an "mental illness and anthropology clinic". His frequent visits to the mental patient hospital, where he assists patients free of charge, allow him to deepen the study of the relationships between genius and neurosis. "The ideas of the greatest thinkers burst from improvisation, unfold unintentionally as the compulsive acts of maniacs," he wrote.\r
At the International Congress of Anthropology, held in Milan, several criticisms were raised against Lombroso's position, but his pioneering in therapy with mental patients was recognized: rational relaxation of treatment (hitherto intolerant), introduction of manual labor, conversations with outsiders, collective amusements, written diaries and printed by the patients themselves. It was a new method, now employed by psychotherapy.\r

In 1864, Lombroso became internationally known thanks to his commented book Genius and Madness, translated into several languages and exerts influence to this day. In 1867, he wrote Astros and Comet Actions on the Human Mind and, the following year, Relations between age, moon positions and access of mental alienations, works received with many reservations by other scientists in the field. \r

A psychiatrist and director of padua's asylum from 1871 to 1876, Lombroso collects enough data for his theories. From the examination of hundreds of mentally ill and criminals, he comes to the conclusion that the criminal is formed by some basic trend inherent in his fate, and that "seeds of a criminal nature" can often be identified in the child. He also believed that the social environment, combined with the astral influences, would prepare for criminal action individuals whose nature was antisocial. \r

In 1876, he won the competition for the Chair of Hygiene and Legal Medicine at the University of Turin. \r

In 1882, in his opubusstudy study on Hypnotism, he ridiculed the spiritist manifestations but, invited by Prof. Morselli to study the subject better, participated in sessions with medium Eus√°pia Palladino, convincing himself of the undeniable veracity of the Facts. The research he did with this medium is found in the book of his author Hypnotism and Mediumship.\r

Cesar Lombroso's works brought him fame, sparked controversy and influenced many legislators and writers. \r

When he went to Moscow in 1897 as a participant in the Psychiatric Congress, he met Tolstoy, who knew very well his ideas about genius and madness. Writers such as Emile Zola and Anatole France also suffered their influence. Among the doctors, Kraepelin, one of the largest classifiers of mental illness, deserves to be highlighted, who under the influence of Lombroso writes about the abolition of feathers. Lawmakers from many countries, inspired by their works, propose reforms of criminal laws.\r

Lombroso, always faithful to the experimental method, bequeathed to the Spiritists an excellent collection of clarifications about mediumship and the vast phenomenological field. A deeply honest man defended the veracity of Spiritism until his death, reported prominently around the world, on October 19, 1909, in Turin.\r

It was the end of the mission, which, in his case, initiated by the inside out, from the position of ridicule to that of sincere defender, would strengthen the Spiritist movement by its own research and defense.\r

God has many paths for men. For Lombroso, the path was to remake its own path, that is, to sediment what he, due to ignorance of reality, had assaulted, by formulating mistaken concepts about Spiritism, portraying himself intimately and publicly a posteriori, through the immense work he did.\r

Cesare Lombroso became world famous for his studies and theories in the field of characterology or the relationship between physical and mental characteristics.\r

Lombroso tried to relate certain physical characteristics, such as the size of the jaw, to criminal psychopathology, or the innate tendency of sociopathic individuals and with criminal behavior. Thus, Lombroso's approach is a direct descendant of phrenology, created by german physicist Franz Joseph Gall in the early 9th century and closely related to other fields of character and physiognomy (study of mental properties from the physiognomy of the individual). His theory was scientifically discredited, but Lombroso had in mind drawing attention to the importance of scientific studies of the criminal mind, a field that became known as criminal anthropology.\r

Lombroso's main idea was partly inspired by genetic and evolutionary studies at the end of the 9th century and proposes that certain criminals have physical evidence of atavism (reappearance of characteristics that were presented only in ascendants hereditary type, reminiscent of more primitive stages of human evolution. These anomalies, called stigmas by Lombroso, could be expressed in terms of abnormal shapes or dimensions of the skull and jaw, asymmetries on the face, etc., but also other parts of the body. Subsequently, these associations were considered highly inconsistent or completely nonexistent, and theories based on the environmental cause of crime became dominant.\r
