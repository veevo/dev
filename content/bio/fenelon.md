François de Salignac de La Mothe, Duke of Fénelon, was born in the family castle,
in Périgord on August 6, 1651. Disembodied in Cambrai on January 7,
1715, at sixty-three years of age.

Until he was twelve, the boy was home-schooled. Your preceptor - the sources
consulted did not mention the name -- had a taste for Latin and Greek, and treated
soon to teach these languages, so that he could become familiar with the masterpieces
classical literature.

By the age of twelve, Fénelon went on to attend the University of
Cahors, where he would complete the studies of philosophy, which would continue at The Du College
Plessis, in Paris, it was in this famous educational establishment that devoted itself to theology
and got to know the abbot of Noailles, also of noble family, and who would end up getting to know the abbot of Noailles, also of noble family, and who would end up
reaching the highest positions in the French ecclesiastical hierarchy.

At the age of fifteen, Fénelon was tasked with preaching his first sermon,
with great success, by the way. You can already see, right in this introduction, that the high
church and politics were made up of high-strain people. Is
this environment in which Fénelon will move for the rest of its existence.

From Du Plessis College, Fénelon passed the seminary of Saint-Sulpice, then under the
direction of Tronson. In 1675, the twenty-four-year-old seminarian was
ordained at the seminary of Saint-Sulpice. Over the next three years, it would play
their ecclesiastical functions together with the other priests of that parish.

It was up to him to explain the gospel texts to the public, on Sundays and holy days.
Actively participated in the tasks of teaching catechism. The church of Saint-Sulpice
still retains its Litanies of L'enfant-Jésus, written especially for the
regulars of his parish.

The young priest intended, by this time, to leave for the East on a mission
apostolic apostolic, with the purpose of converting to Christianity as many pagans as it was
possible to achieve, with the brightness of his word and the breadth of his theological culture.
But that would not be his destiny, since "Nouvelles catholiques", it was about
an institution tasked with welcoming newly converted young people and ladies from the
Protestantism to Catholicism, in order to consolidate in them the good and Orthodox doctrine of the
Church. Parallel objective was to instruct those who were willing to
abandon heresy.

The concern of Catholic leaders - Prelates and laity - in salvation was great
of souls who had the misfortune of letting themselves be attracted by the "dangerous" ideas of
Luther. In 1681, the bishop of Sarlat - noble too ! - Fénelon's uncle, resigned, in
nephew's favour, to carenas' decanate, who surrendered three to four thousand pounds
French women a year, Fénelon left the New Catholics for some time in order to take
inauguration of the new post, but soon returned to Paris and retook the direction of the institution,
where it would remain for ten years.

He wrote during that period, De L'éducation des filles, the first significant work in his
career as a writer and educator. The book, requested by the Duchess of Beauviller to
guide her in the education of her daughters, achieved great success, becoming the work of
reference for the families of the time, as well as a consultation text for scholars of the
Pedagogy.

Thanks to its simplicity, sweetness and charity, Fénelon has achieved considerable success
in the task, being able to quickly convert large numbers of people. Fénelon does not
he deluded himself with his numerous achievements, recognizing that not all were sincere.
A realistic assessment, this one. With minority protestants and outlawed posts, the
Catholicism had become more comfortable or, at the very least, safer. Even so,
adds, the result of his mission was considered "very satisfactory".

However, he did not escape some criticism. It's just that the church's most radical wards
attacked his conversion methods and considered him "too condescending
with the hereticals." He chose not to justify himself.

In the meantime, poitiers bishopric was wandered. Fénelon's name was indicated and the
king agreed, but the appointment did not come to fruition, it is said, because
of the intrigues of the noble lord of Harlay, Archbishop of Paris, who had there his
disagreements with Bossuet, and did not see with good eyes Fénelon's friendship with his rival.
All in the best style of the worst behind-the-scenes politics.

By that same time, Fénelon suffered another setback. Someone -- it would still be you
Archbishop of Paris ? - convinced the king to deny him the appointment as co-adjutor of the
archbishop of La Rochelle, who desired him as a collaborator.

Shortly after, in 1689, the good winds of success blew again in favour of the
young prelate. The Duke of Beauvilliers, appointed "governor" of the young Duke of
Burgundy - grandson of the king and presumptive heir of the crown - chose Fénelon for the
honorable position of preceptor of the prince. As we are reminded, he had written, the
request of the Duchess of Beauvillers, a book intended to guide her in the education of
couple's daughters.

Fénelon soon devoted himself to working to correct the behaviour of the
prince through fables, which he himself was writing. He then wrote the
curious Dialogues des Morts (Dialogue of the Dead), ingenious and creative text, in which
put the dialogue of historical personalities of the past, committed to (re)assessing their
(unrelated) acts and posture.

Fénelon's last years have been saddened by the desencarne of his best
Friends. In late 1710 he lost Abbe of Langeron, his lifelong companion;
in February 1712, disembodied his student, Duke of Burgundy. A few months more
late the Duke of Chevreuse was taken, and the Duke of Beauvillers followed in August
1714. Fénelon survived only a few more months. With him disappeared one of the
most illustrious members of the French episcopate, certainly one of the most attractive men
of his time. It owes its success only to its great talents and virtues
Admirable.

Fénelon appears in the Codification at various times, and can be quoted: "The Book
of the Spirits", where prolegômeros sign, next to a pleiade of spiritual luminades.
The answer to question 917 is also your special responsibility.
In "The Gospel According to Spiritism", it presents itself at various times,
speaking about the third revelation and the moral revolution of man (cap. I, 10); The
man of good and voluntary torments (cap. V.22 - 23); the law of love (cap. XI, 9); The
hatred(cap. XII,10) and the use of wealth(cap. XVI,13).

In "The Book of Mediums", it appears in the chapter of Spiritist Dissertations (cap.
XXXI, 2nd part, items XXI and XXII), developing aspects about spiritist meetings
and the multiplicity of spiritist groups.

It is important to note that the highlights highlighted are those in which the spirit
signs its name and should be considered to be, as the other responsible
by coding, to have been present at many other times, giving their
contribution, beest, who was invited by the Spirit of Truth to compose his
team, in such great enterprise.
