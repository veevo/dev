Batuíra was born on March 19, 1839, in Portugal, in the parish of Águas Santas, now integrated into the council of Maia. The son of humble peasants, having only completed primary education, came, at the age of 11, to Brazil, landing in Guanabara on January 3, 1850.

For three years he worked in the Court trade. From there he moved to Campinas-SP, where he stayed for some time, until he transferred permanently to the state capital, which, at the time, had less than 30,000 inhabitants. Then, in the early years, he was a distributor of Correio Paulistano. At that time, there were no newsstands in the public places. The delivery was made in the afternoon, from house to house, and only to subscribers.

Diligent, honest and docile spirit, Batuíra, as a newspaper delivery man, was forming friends and admirers everywhere. It seems that it was in this period that he learned typographic art, certainly in the workshops of correio Paulistano.

Batuíra, very active, running from here to there, was nicknamed "the batuíra", name that the people gave to the narcissist, bird pernalta, very light, fast flight, which frequented the ponds in the lowland formed, in the current Parque D. Pedro II, by the overflows of Rio Mr. Tamanduateí. The boy's name was Antonio Gonçalves da Silva, but from then on, he took to himself the nickname Of Batuíra.

In a short time, with the savings he gathered, and of course with the help of friendly people, he set up a little screen in the back of a tavern on Cruz Preta Street. In that modest concert hall, many amateurs made their debut, including Batuíra.

Persevering in his faina, he then devoted himself to the manufacture of cigars. Thus, with a lot of work and economics, Batuíra grew his modest finances, which allowed him to marry Brandina Maria de Jesus, of whom he had a son, Joaquim Gonçalves Batuíra, who died after a man made and married.

Audacious, like the great entrepreneurs, invested their money in buying devalued areas, starting the construction of small houses to rent, thus becoming a wealthy owner, whose possessions translated the fruit of many years of hard work and honored, united to unbreakable perseverance.

At the time when everything seemed to go well, the only son of his second wife, D. Maria das Dores Coutinho e Silva, dies almost suddenly. He was a twelve-year-old child, for whom the couple were extremely in dedication and affection.

This blow deeply injured that home, which can only find lenitive for pain in the comforting Doctrine of Spirits.

So great was peace that Spiritism infused them, that Batuíra immediately got to work, in the ardent desire that other earthly toil companions would be aware of that blessed source of new hopes. And within that low body and robust completeness, a heart of gold would give wider expansion to its noble feelings of love for others.

In 1889, Batuíra became, in the city of São Paulo, the exclusive agent of the Reformer, a function that was in charge until 1899 or 1900.

On April 6, 1890, he restored the Spiritist Truth and Light Group, which had long been asleep.

He then acquired a small typography, intended for the dissemination and propagation of Spiritism, editing the fortnightly publication called Truth and Light, which reached, in 1897, the mark of 15,000 copies.

Batuíra was also a healing medium, with hundreds being the healings of a physical and spiritual character that obtained by ministering fluidized water or applying magnetic passes.

By virtue of all these facts, the people, most benefited by Batuíra, began to appoint him doctor of the poor, cognomen who also received the name of Adolfo Bezerra de Menezes.

Batuíra's benemérite action is not limited, however, to these manifestations of Christian charity. It went much further. He created Spiritist Groups and Centers in São Paulo, Minas Gerais, State of Rio, which animated and watched; held conferences on various doctrinal themes in numerous cities in several States, when he also visited and healed suffering brothers; spread free prospectuses and propaganda brochures of Spiritism, by itself printed, and distributed thousands of books throughout the country.

Batuíra, united with other illustrious confreres, constituted in the state capital, on May 24, 1908, the Spiritist Union of the State of S. Paulo, which would federate all existing Centers and Groups in the State.

Thus was the valiating worker of the Third Revelation, the tireless caretaker who never let himself be slaughtered by the roughness of the journey, having been undeniably one of the greatest propagandists of Spiritism in Brazil.

Carrying on his shoulders many responsibilities, he did not feel, so imprisoned he thought to fulfill his duties, that his vital forces were exhausted quickly. Sudden illness assaults his body and thus, in a few days, transposes the aduanas from beyond. On January 22, 1909, Friday, about an hour in the morning, Mr. Antônio Gonçalves da Silva Batuíra died.
