Hugo Gonçalves, daddy. So it is known and affectionately called throughout
northern Paraná, \r missionary Hugo Gonçalves, disciple of Cairbar Schutel and
support of the Spiritist Doctrine in this \r State of the Federation.\r

Already close to the 94 years of age, continues what began since childhood,
under the wise guidance of the \r late Bandeirante do Spiritism. Not only does
love and charity preach, but especially practices them. \r Therefore, by
radiating so much sympathy, all who have known him for a long time or come to
know him, \r consider it a true grace of God.\r

In 1880 a family of Portuguese immigrants led by Francisco Ferreira and
Conceição dos Santos arrived in Brazil. Among the children who constituted the
offspring, he drew attention to the youngest, named Cândida, with just over 1
year. The family settled in the village of Boa Esperança, near Rio Claro, in the
State of São Paulo. A few years later, in 1888, already 20 years old and alone,
arrives in Brazil and settles in the same place, another Portuguese immigrant
with the imposing name of José Maria Gonçalves. José Maria arrived alone, but
well accompanied by spiritual entities that led him to Boa Esperança, for there
was already his promised consort and companion of all life − Cândida − both with
a serious commitment to generate our blessed Hugo Gonçalves. José Maria and
Cândida married in 1893 and moved to Matão around 1897. They then befriended the
kind local pharmacist, Mr. Cairbar de Souza Schutel.\r

Hugo Gonçalves returned to the physical world on October 6, 1913. The midwife
was Cairbar Schutel, who suggested that the shoot be called Vitor Hugo, his
favorite literary author. Dona Cândida liked Hugo, but not Vitor.\r

At the age of 12, he revealed a good literary trend, going on to write for the
Newspaper O Clarim, founded and directed by his master Cairbar Schutel, in
Matão-SP. It is worth recalling a poem that the boy Hugo wrote at that time:\r

From the age of 13, he began to work with the other brothers, performing hard
tasks in the quarry owned by his father, having as a companion and instrument, a
sledgehammer sisuda. Still in full adolescence, in the school, every day was a
beautiful descendant of Italians, who discovered herself to be Dulce Ângela
Caleffi ("The Little Mother of Cambé"). She, just over time, noticed that
interesting look. It soon felt some hooks in his heart. For a few years the
future romance was only in flirtation.\r

The effective dating only occurred after the death of Arturo, Dulce's father, in
1930. They were married on September 21, 1935. Around 1940, already with his son
Cairbar, he moved to the region of Campinas, where he remained a few years, also
breaking stones. He returned to Matão, now with his second son, Emanuel, to
continue his work at the family quarry. Soon after, he was invited to work on
the administration of a large farm, situated near Matão.\r

In 1947, he moved to Paraná, settling in the Londrina region. He continued to
work in farm management until 1953. That year, he settled in Cambé (Paraná),
going on to run the Marília Barbosa Children's Home, which he does with a lot of
love and affection to this day.\r

Hugo Gonçalves had thirteen brothers, three of whom disincarnated children. He's
the only survivor in the family. He says because he's always been the most
stubborn. He has two children, thirteen grandchildren, eighteen
great-grandchildren and thirty-six nephews. He holds several honorary titles,
for his unceasing work and directed to the good of the next, notably of the
children and the elderly desvalidos. After a week of icu admission, Mrs Dulce,
her beloved companion of almost 68 years, affected by cardio-respiratory
problems, came to disincarnate on May 19, 2003, about to complete 87 years of
fruitful and blessed existence.\r

In March 2003, the book Hugo Gonçalves was launched and the man who remembers
the Sermon on the Mountain. It is a biographical work. Alongside the tribute, it
is also an effort to relegate any and unjust veal of an exemplary life entirely
dedicated to the love advocated by Christ in the future decades, when his
relatives, friends and companions today, are no longer on the plan Physical.\r

## Institutions and Works Directed by Hugo Gonçalves\r

### Spiritist Center Allan Kardec\r

Founded in the 1940s, by Luiz Picinin, and maintained and directed by Hugo Gonçalves, since 1953, the Spiritist Center Allan Kardec is duly registered in the CNPJ under no. 75,759.399/0001-98, based on Rua Pará, 292, in the city of Cambe - PR. This Nucleus has been operating since then uninterruptedly. Every day there are activities. On Wednesdays, afternoon and evening, there are doctrinal works, with lectures, passes and free distribution of books (sweepstakes). On Thursdays and Fridays, psychic sessions. In the other days, several meetings, including gospel studies.\r

The influx of adherents is very large. The auditorium, which has capacity for about 200 people, from time to time it gets crowded. Next, eminent scholars of spiritist doctrine are invited for lectures. Both Paraná and other states. When speakers are famous speakers, such as Divaldo Franco, Raul Teixeira etc., the events are held in other broader venues. Through this Center have passed, in addition to the great speakers and speakers of today (to name only a few: Divaldo, Raul, Baccelli, Heloisa Pires, Eliseu Mota, Felipe Salomão, Terezinha Oliveira, Richardo Simonetti, Sebastião M. Moura, Dayse Steagall Gomes , etc.), eminent figures such as José Soares Cardoso, Eurícledes Formiga, João Leão Pitta, Urbano Assis Xavier, Sergio Lourenço and so many others.\r

Once, Luiz Gonzaga, the famous King of Baião, was in Londrina for a show. Hugo Gonçalves didn't leave it for less. After the presentation he told him about the children he kept in the Home and that they would love to hear him. The next day Lua gave a magnificent show in the hall of the Center.\r

Hugo does "expedient" there every day, as if he were a devoted and assiduous employee. In addition to the management work, the coordination of activities, it serves the numerous public that seeks it for various reasons: spiritual help, advice, requests for food, clothing, money and so on. Hugo has no income but a measly retirement of a minimum wage. One day, in the office, a lady arrived looking extreme poverty. I wanted a cash help to buy milk and stuff for the kids, claiming to have been abandoned by her husband. She was a very lucky poor woman. The charitable Hugo should have received his payment the day before. She expressly asked for R$ 5.00. Hugo put his hand in his pocket and plucked what he had: a single bill of R $ 50.00. Without blinking, you gave it to that woman. She was left with nothing but happy for the great happiness she saw emblazoned on her face. We wondered what Hugo thought at that moment. The woman asked for five reais. He was only fifty. How to order change of forty-five? It was giving everything or nothing. You had no doubt. He gave it all and ran out of nowhere. But from little things in little things like this, he accumulates treasures in the Kingdom of Heaven. Millions and tons of gold are of no use at the time of truth, accountability. Charity is a very valuable credit card you take.\r

### Marília Barbosa Children's Home\r

Marília Barbosa Children's Home is a Department of the Allan Kardec Spiritist Center. It has its own legal personality and is registered with the CNPJ under no. 78.302.650/0001-89, with headquarters in Rua Dinamarca, 1,288, in Cambe - PR, with building on the same land where the Center operates.\r

When talking about this blessed and always solid institution, mister is remembered two true Atlas (giant who carried the Earth and the Firmament on the back) of charity, responsible for uninterrupted success for half a century: Luiz Picinin and Hugo Gonçalves.\r

Luiz Picinin, his creator and founder, had Italian and maternal German paternal ancestry. He was born in Taquaritinga-SP on January 6, 1919. From the age of 15, he was pleased to read spiritist books, embracing the Doctrine. Landed in Cambé in 1942, from his hometown. He faced many difficulties because of the prejudices suffered by the Germans and Italians because of the war. Like Hugo, who spent his adolescence and much of the youth in very hard labor, Picinin worked heavy services. Working as a looter in a coffee machine, it was not long, very intelligent and dynamic that it was, to idealize a business of its own, with their colleagues: they opened a beneficiary. Picinin suggested and all partners accepted to allocate 20% of the profits for welfare works.\r

By his influence, most became spiritist. Spiritism also in Cambé was not well seen by the population, a fact that hindered the business. Still, there was no discouragement. On the contrary, Picinin and his companions decided to found a Center and later a night hostel. When Picinin arrived in Cambé, many immigrant families, devoid of any resources, were huddled in the central square, sleeping in the relent, until they got some placement.\r

On a cold night, a child died entangled. This tragic fact has shut down picinin's sensitive soul. On a visit to the city of Nova Iguaçu-RJ, he met an institution run by Leopoldo Machado, which housed helpless children. An image was always alive in his mind, for the generosity and willingness to that work: Ms. Marília Barbosa, leopoldo's teacher and devoted wife. Enthusiastic, Picinin and his spiritist friends decided to create, in Cambé, an institution similar to the one that had enchanted him so much.\r

Then was born the idea of the Home that would soon flourish. It was inaugurated, in its own headquarters, on March 29, 1953. After a few months, Hugo began to direct him, relying on the essential collaboration and heroic and tireless work of Mrs. Dulce, his late wife. In this half century there passed, in a boarding school regime, more than 300 girls.\r

Most came at an early age, leaving only by marriage or after acquiring, by profession or employment, conditions of their own sustenance. The Marília Barbosa Children's Home, due to the relevant services it has been providing to the community, since its foundation, is municipal, state, state and nationally recognized as public utility. To this end, Hugo Gonçalves did not measure efforts and had the support of the political class. The Home survives donations that are generously dispensed to him.\r

### Daycare \r
In addition to boarding school, the Home maintains a well-organized daycare with all the requirements \r
indispensable to the physical and mental development of children, in number never less than 70.\r

### Mother's Club \r
For several years a group of ladies have been providing relevant services to the Center and home. They are voluntary seamstresses that take turns, so that every day there are some working in the appropriate room. They make and renovate clothes for the inmates of the Home, for the children of the day care center, as well as for newborns of needy families, in the maternities of Cambé. Materials are purchased with home resources. There are also donations.\r

### Dental Office \r
Also, for several years, the Spiritist Center Allan Kardec has maintained a dental office in its premises. All equipment, including a chair, was donated by third parties. The service is done by trained dentists, from the board of servers of the municipality, which also provides the necessary materials. There all children are regularly attended.\r

### Medical Care \r
Although with its own office, care is usually done in doctors' offices. This is due to the greater resources and greater convenience of professionals who serve free all children in the nursery and internal sums of the Home. Cambé's entire medical class collaborates. There is no case of refusal to comply with the requests of Hugo Gonçalves. When more specialized treatment is needed, patients are referred by physicians themselves to colleagues in Londrina at no cost. If doctors do not have, in their offices, free samples of the remedies, these are purchased by the Entity.\r

### Food Baskets \r
Every Saturday, the Spiritist Center Allan Kardec distributes about 100 food baskets to underprivileged families, with predominance of fruit products. Before distribution, the people who run there, in search of food for the body, receive food for the soul. They hear, in the auditorium, doctrinal teachings. Presence is not a condition for the receipt of baskets, but all people, professing diverse religions, listen carefully to gospel lessons, in the light of Spiritism.\r

### The Immortal \r
This newspaper is an important chapter in the life of Hugo Gonçalves. It circulates throughout Brazil, also reaching some other countries. Discreetly, but enough. It has been around the clock since December 1953. On some occasions, when people went to visit Chico Xavier, said the venerable Apostle of the Master, identifying themselves as residents of Cambé: "Ah!, of Cambé, the land of Hugo and the Immortal? Chico was a reader. Advertisements and subscription product have often gone short-to-head only for coverage of editing and posting expenses. Be you, reader friend, also a subscriber to this newspaper of the future, as ranked Cairbar Schutel, in a mediumistic manifestation. The subscription can be requested from voice mail 63 in Cambé, or by calling (043) 254-3261. The email is: jornalimortal@onda.com.br\r

### Night Hostel \r
The night hostel was also the idea of Luiz Picinin and whose direction was passed on to Hugo Gonçalves, along with The Lar. It worked from 1942 until the 1970s, being disabled due to the gradual absence of users.\r

In Hugo's office there is a vetoe book, quite marked by the intense handling it had, where the entrances of users of the hostel were recorded. In the last leaf used, there is the entrance of Laudelina Cândida Talara, who received no. 46,233. This would have been the number of people (those registered) attended at the night hostel founded by Luiz Picinin and affectionately maintained by Hugo Gonçalves, until the last day of operation.\r

### Coral \r
Coral Hugo Gonçalves was created on August 3, 1997 and since then, despite all the difficulties, mainly financial, has been developing its activities with great strength and brightness. Each presentation is a success, drawing warm applause from the auditoriums. In its vast repertoire are religious songs and also of a popular and folk nature. Many pieces contain doctrinal content, with Christian teachings. \r

The regency is in charge of the competent conductor José Mário Tomal. Coral has performed in several states and has participated in many festivals and coral gatherings, with groups even foreigners, obtaining unique highlights. He recently had a small season in the northeast, singing very successfully in Maceió and Salvador. In the soteropolitan capital, the presentation was in the magnificent Mansion of the Way, receiving high praise from Divaldo Franco. Due to financial difficulties, he has been on the verge of extinction several times. As each member pays a maintenance quota, today the number is reduced to less than half. Yet it goes ahead, conveying to all much joy, enping and peace.\r

Sextet \r
In addition to Coral, the Spiritist Center Allan Kardec has a musical group (still unnamed, but that would be fine being called Sexteto Hugo Gonçalves) composed of 6 members of coral that performs in the evening meetings of Wednesday, singing songs exclusively of a religious nature. He doesn't have a conductor, but he's guided by Wilson, one of the members, with his well-known guitar. A well-tuned group that prepares the environment for indoctrination work, dusting peace effluvians with their gentle chants.\r

## MY PRAYER \r
Jesus, Educator of Humanity,  \r
Who said, "Let the little ones  \r
Come to me to have..."  \r
Teach me how to form the paladins of justice, good and truth.  \r
Teach me how to teach well-being.  \r
With words, examples and affections,  \r
Gives me to lead to the desired port  \r
These souls in bloom.  \r
That every heart touched by me  \r
Have good scent of the seases  \r
Wherever divine love is. May I never be stumbling stone,  \r
That I never scandalize a child,  \r
That I know how to respect your heart,  \r
Give me this powerful and tame force,  \r
This gift of educating that is priceless,  \r
Talent, effort, love and inspiration.  \r
