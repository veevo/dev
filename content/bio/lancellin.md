Lancellin is a Spirit responsible for authoring some of the psychographed works
by medium João Nunes Maia. His last reincarnation took place in France in the
19th century, as a spiritualist writer who specializes in psychic phenomena,
specializing in study about astral travel.

Researched xenoglossia (mediumistic college that allows the medium to speak one
or more languages unknown) and the unfolding. 

In his work "Initiation, Astral Journey", dictated to medium João Nunes Maia he
reports on the subject with the following assertion: "The unfolding was
especially interested in me.  "Behold," I thought, "the greatest proof of the
existence and survival of the soul." And thank God, I was able to prove it,
though little that heaven so has allowed me to consciously accomplish."

> Spirit. Editora Espírita Fonte Viva, 2004, 12th edition.

He also devoted himself to knowing and experiencing the gospel of Jesus, having
reported on the fact that in this same book dictated to João Nunes Maia that
"Even in this reincarnation as Lancellin, I have already begun to value the
teachings of the Divine Master of Nazareth. I felt the depth of Christ's mission
and began to cultivate virtues. At first, I encountered a lot of difficulties. 

The body's own rejection accustomed to heavy vibrations, then the reaction of
others bodies that follow are terrible things. However, the same Master teaches
us that he who persevere to the end will be saved. This is the truth, we will be
saved from the passing illusions of the world, to enter the immortal beauties of
the Spirit, where there is no regression, only advance; where there is no alms
or favoritism, only conquest. Millennial experiences make us believe that only
love offers us means for eternal happiness."

## Self-Effort
In the paths we have come, we will notice the evident lessons that God has already done His part, 
lacking only ours, for integration into the common good, where love came to 
awaken the qualities of life, where they slept.

The "search and find" of the Gospel is great; is to seek within ourselves, where there is 
everything that the science of life has put, so that our own efforts make us find.

"Ask and you will get"! The request, in spiritual science is to seek for work, in the action 
of love and charity. The "request and obtain" is certainly to ask for the word of honest work; 
these are the sounds that spirituality hears and answers, in the notes, in the writings they save, 
in the function of love and, by your blessed hands, under the command of lucid mind, will be written: 
"Help your fellow to lift the burden, but do not carry it by it." 
Behold, everyone must and can do his duty, doing his part, fulfilling his obligation.

Work with love opens channels for peace of conscience. It is up to each one to work to help others, 
but always stay vigilant, not to do the part that belongs to others. It is good that we remember 
Jesus, on the rise of Calvary, where the circus helped lift the cross, when Christ fell, but did 
not take it all the time, for it was the master's mission. He took it himself and, extended on the 
logger, forgave His tormentors and even said that they were not bad but ignorant, not knowing what 
they were doing.

He works closely, helping, but don't take away your brother's opportunity to break free himself.
