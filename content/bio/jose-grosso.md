José Grosso is the name of a spiritual entity. Through psychophony or semi-direct voice, this spirit communicates in spiritist centers throughout Brazil, especially in the groups of the Brotherhood Movement.

Among his supposed various incarnations, he had power and authority, particularly in Germania, where he had the name "Johannes", having died around the year 751.

He later lived in the Netherlands, where he would have held the position of diplomatic attaché. In these functions, he will have lived with the nobility and clergy of the Netherlands and the Court of Francis I of France. According to information from Spirituality, it is reported that Jair Soares, psychic director already disembodied of the Scheilla Group (Belo Horizonte), had Francisco I himself, which would explain to some the great connection between the two.

He reincarnated in 1896 in Brazil, in a place near Crato, in the then province of Ceará, when he was baptized as José da Silva. It will have been his parents, Jerome and Francisca, who had nine children in all.

In the early 1930s, given the misery imposed by droughts in the Northeast region of Brazil will have integrated the cangaço movement, under lampião's leadership.

In living with the gang, he realized that he extrapolated his aspirations for justice and freedom. He understood that the way she acted was not the right one and, even aware of the consequences, changed his behavior. Although he did not decant his companions to the authorities, he began to inform the villages that would be invaded, so that women and children would be spared. Discovered, Lampião pierced his eyes with the knife, ading himself from betrayal. José da Silva, lost in the woods with widespread infection, will have died in 1936 at the age of 40, without having any news of seven of his eight brothers. He knew the whereabouts of a single brother, known as Palminha, who at the time carried the same kind of life in the cangaço, but belonging to another group.

It is claimed that after having died, after some time wandering in blindness, he was supported by the spirit of Nina Arueira. He began his learning in the Spiritual Plan with the Glacus Spirit and, for long years, was under the guidance of Scheilla. Twelve years later, he began to manifest himself at the Spiritist Center Oriente and in the house of Jair Soares, director of the Scheilla Group, in Belo Horizonte.

In 1949, in his first communications, he claimed to be "fallen leaf from the winds of the North". Taken by Scheilla and Joseph Gleber, he also began to manifest himself in the Spiritist Group André Luiz in Rio de Janeiro, through some mediums, especially the well-known Peixotinho, for which the entities Scheilla and Dr. Garcez were manifested.

Since 1949 he has been cooperating in the meetings of psychophonia and spiritual treatment in groups of the Brotherhood Movement. Currently it manifests itself in numerous spiritist homes throughout Brazil, including the Spiritist Fraternity Brother Glacus and the André Luiz Fraternity both of Uberlândia (Minas Gerais), at the Spiritist Center José Grosso, in the city of Imperatriz (Maranhão) and Spiritist Union Diogo de Vasconcelos Lisboa in João Pessoa (Paraíba).

"Zé" as we affectionately call him, he is also a well-known and respected companion in the seara. We therefore transcribe its exciting story also obtained from the Site of the House of Glacus, this time described by friend Palminha:

Spirit of great feeling, very friendly, had many wanderings through various bodies.

He had power and a lot of authority in his hands, especially from Germania. However, he was mystical, rigid and disciplined. At that time, José Grosso was called Johannes and defaced around the year 751.

In one of his incarnations was his consanguineous brother Brother Palminha (now also spiritual mentor of the Fraternity). José Grosso reincarnated himself again in the Netherlands as Adide Diplomática. He lived with the Dutch upper class and the court of Francis I - king of France. According to information on spirituality, it is reported that Jair Soares (psychic director of spiritist nucleus already disembodied) was King Francisco I. With this information is explained the great connection between the two. During this period, José Grosso gained great friendships through his diplomatic activities.

José da Silva was born in the arid corners of Ceará in brazil, in a small place near Crato. His parents Geronius and Francisca had 09 children.

In the early 1930s rumors invaded the entire vastness of the suffering Northeast. Misery, drought, suffering, lack of everything. No more cuts and the relative command. When some men appropriated the property of the rich to distribute them to the poor. This greatly perlastized the heart of José da Silva who in his heart dreamed of a "promised land", with more peace, health and food suitable for all. This mob of men was like Chief Lampião. In the Orós region, José Grosso, already an adult joined this group of wishes equal to his own, that is, to help his likes at any cost.

With the coexistence with the gang, José da Silva realized that they extrapolated their aspirations. He realized that the way they acted was not correct and knowing the consequences of these acts changed their behavior. He did not report the group to the authorities, but went on to inform the cities that they would be invaded so that women and children would be spared. This behavior led Lampião to pierce his eyes with the knife, admering himself from the betrayal suffered. José da Silva lost in the woods, with widespread infection, defaced in 1936 at the age of 40, without having any news of his seven brothers. He knew the whereabouts of a single brother - now Palminha - at the time, lived the same kind of life, but belonging to another group.

After his untangled, when he woke up on the spiritual plane, he had at his side the spirit of Scheilla and Joseph Gleber, who had ties to him in Germania. Twelve years later, the spirits Scheilla and Joseph Gleber took the spirit of José da Silva to the core that met in the house of Jair Soares. There he first spoke out there.

In 1949, in his first communications, he claimed to be fallen leaf from the winds of the North. Also taken by Scheilla and Joseph began to manifest itself in the Spiritist Group André Luiz, in Rio de Janeiro, through some mediums and mainly through the well-known medium Peixotinho. The spirits José Grosso, Scheilla and Dr. Garcez were manifested by Peixotinho, medium who was also a doctor in the age of 79.

Joseph grosso began his journey on the spiritual plane to glacus' spirit. For long years he was under the guidance of Scheilla in the spiritual field, working in a dedicated and operaus spiritist nucleus in Belo Horizonte.

We thank Jesus for the opportunity to work with such dedicated brothers. May God enlighten you so that they may continue their journey!
