Born on November 5, 1839 in Domington, England, William Stainton Moses began his
studies under the direction of his father and was then entrusted to a private
teacher. In 1855, he joined bedford grammar school, where he studied for three
years. At the age of 23, Stainton Moses returned to Oxford, where he received
his diploma. In 1870, his attention was drawn to Spiritism during his time at
Dr. Speers's london home.\r

Two years later, he began studying the Doctrine by attending some spiritist
sessions. In a session held at the residence of the Couple Speers, having
Stainton Moses as a medium, all became convinced of the reality of the existence
of communicating spirits, thus consolidating the belief in the immortality of
the soul. During the active period of his mediumship, the researcher took care
of the formation of societies in order to study Spiritism.\r

He contributed to the founding of the British National Association of
Spiritualists, the Psychological Society of Great Britain, the Society of
Psychic Research, and the Spiritualist Alliance of London. Since 1889, his
health has been greatly impaired, causing his disincarnation on September 5,
1892.\r
