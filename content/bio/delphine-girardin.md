Who are the Spirits who sign the messages of Coding? In Prolegômenos, from the
basilar work The Book of Spirits, are the names of St. John the Evangelist, St
Augustine, St. Vincent de Paul, St. Louis, The Spirit of Truth, Socrates, Plato,
Fénelon, Franklin, Swedenborg, among others.\r

In The Gospel according to Spiritism parade more than a dozen names of Spirits,
better known to each other, almost unknown to others, among them those of
Delphine de Girardin, Hahnemann, Henri Heine, Lacordaire, Lamennais, Morlot,
Pascal, Vianney.\r

But, after all, who are these exponents who made up the team that disescortined
the world to Third Revelation?\r

Here, we are interested in some biographical data from Delphine de Girardin, who
was born in Aix-La-Chapelle on January 26, 1804, the same year as the Encoder,
and defaced in the French capital on June 29, 1855. He married Émile de
Girardin, a French journalist and politician, and then became known as Mrs.
Émile de Girardin. She herself became a journalist after her marriage in 1831,
writing in the newspaper La Presse, from 1836 to 1848, under the pseudonym
Viscount of Launay, interesting chronicles of the society of the time of Luís
Filipe. These chronicles became known as Parisian letters.\r

He also published novels, tragedies and comedies. He was positively a great
inspired medium. A well-known personality in the poetic environment, attending
the literary halls of Mme. Récamier, where the celebrities of the moment met,
very natural that she would make contact with the spinning tables.\r

From the first contact with the tables, she became convinced of the veracity of
the demonstrations. He had the opportunity to meet, personally, professor
Rivail, possibly at one of the meetings he attended in his research around the
phenomena that haunted Paris.\r

Victor Hugo's personal friend, the political events of 1851 and the exile of his
friends marked her cruelly.\r

True to friendship, she decided to bring moral comfort to the poor outlaw. He
launched herself into the sea and, on September 6, in the summer of 1855
(December 6), Madame Delphine de Girardin, landed on the Isle of Jersey for a
visit to the Hugo family, then installed in a villa known as Marine Terrace. It
brought, in addition to the news of the political and social life of Paris, news
about the mania then in vogue in the French capital: contact with the dead
through the table.\r

She then told the unbelievers members of the Hugo family that the tables were
beating and mysteriously leaning, as they could also be led to beat whole words
and sentences in code. Dynamic, however, she did not let herself be too shot. A
little sad and melancholic, but equally happy to review her friends, she met
Victor Hugo and his family.\r

Auguste Vacquerie (1819-1895), who also visited the Hugo family, he who had been
coined by young Leopoldine, daughter of Victor Hugo, tragically killed in an
accident on the River Seine, recorded, in detail, madame Girardin's stay on
Marine Terrace:\r

Was it the intuition of her death (Mme. Girardin knew herself very ill and would
die a year and shortly thereafter) that made her interested in extraterrena
life? (...) I was very worried about the spinning tables, and, I think, the
first word you addressed me was to ask if I believed them. She believed, and
spent the night evoking the dead... She made an absolute point that everyone
participated in her conviction and, on the same day of her arrival, we had work
to make her wait for dinner to end.  He rose to dessert and dragged one of the
convivas to the parlour where they tormented a table that, moreover, remained
mute. She put the blame on the table, whose square shape contradicted the
fluids. The morning of the next day was to buy, in a toy house, a round table,
one foot, ending in a rooster's finger.\r

The table acquired by Mme. de Girardin served exactly its purposes; however,
nothing happened. "The Spirits , he clarified , they were not horses, who
patiently expect the bourgeois, but free and gifted beings of will; come when
they want to." The sessions were long and tiring. Victor Hugo, skeptical, joined
the meetings just so he wouldn't dislike his friend.\r

After several failed attempts, bee, a slight click on the wood was heard.
Finally, on Sunday, September 11, concentration and silence were rewarded. The
click was repeated. Suddenly one of his feet rose. Mme. de Girardin said, "Is
there anyone present? If there is and you want to talk to us, take a beat. The
foot fell with a dry noise – There's someone, Shouted Mme. from Girardin. You
ask the questions."\r

A communication happened. A communication that would change the course of the
great French poet's life. Whoever communicated, through the table was nothing
more, nothing less than his daughter Leopoldine. Her beloved daughter, killed
during her honeymoon, drowned in a lake on a boat trip with her husband.\r

In The Gospel according to Spiritism, the Spirit of Delphine de Girardin signs
the message The real unhappiness, in chapter V, item 24, then transcribed\r

> "Everyone talks about unhappiness, everyone has experienced it and believes to
> know its multiple character. I come to tell you that almost everyone is wrong,
> and that real unhappiness is not all that men, i.e. the unfortunate ones,
> suppose it. They see her in misery, on the stove without fire, in the menacing
> creditor, in the empty cradle of the angel who smiled, in tears, in the faith
> that accompanies itself with a broken head and heart, in the anguish of
> betrayal, in the nudity of the proud who would like to cover himself as purple
> and that is count with difficulty his nudity under the tatters of vanity; to
> all this, and to other things still, it is called unhappiness in human
> language. Yes, it is unhappiness for those who see nothing but the present;
> but true unhappiness lies in the consequences of one thing, more than in the
> very thing. Tell me if the happiest event for the moment, but that has
> profound consequences, is not in reality more unfortunate than the one that
> causes a living setback first, and it turns out to be good? Tell me if the
> storm that breaks your trees, but it saneifs the air by dispelting the
> unhealthy myasms that would cause death, is not rather happiness than
> unhappiness.\r

> "To judge something it is necessary, therefore, to see the consequences; this
> is how, in order to appreciate what is really happy or unhappy for man, one
> must move beyond this life, because that is where the consequences are felt;
> Now, everything called unhappiness according to his short vision ceases with
> life and finds his compensation in the future life.\r

> "I will reveal unhappiness to you in a new form, in the beautiful and flowery
> form you welcome and desire with all the strengthof your mistaken souls.
> Unhappiness is joy, it is pleasure, it is fame, it is vain agitation, it is
> the crazy satisfaction of vanity, which make the conscience shut up, which
> compress the action of thought, which stun man over his future; unhappiness is
> the opium of forgetfulness that you complain ardently.\r

> "Wait, you who cry! I trembled, you ride, because your body is satisfied! God
> is not deceived; does not shy away from fate; and the evidence, more ruthless
> creditors than the pack excited by misery, lurk your illusory rest to suddenly
> immerse you in the agony of true unhappiness, one that surprises the soul
> weakened by indifference and selfishness.\r

> "Let Spiritism enlighten you, therefore, and put in its true light the truth
> and error, so strangely disfigured by your blindness! Then you will act like
> brave soldiers who, far from fleeing danger, prefer the struggles of reckless
> fighting, peace that cannot give neither glory nor progress. What matters to
> the soldier losing his weapons, his luggage and his uniforms, as long as he
> wins the winner and glory! What does it matter to him who has faith in the
> future to leave on the battlefield of life his fortune and his mantle of
> flesh, as long as his soul enters, radiosa, in the celestial kingdom?"
> (Girardin Delphine, Paris, 1861.)\r
