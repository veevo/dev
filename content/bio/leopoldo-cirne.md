Leopoldo Cirne served as President of the Brazilian Spiritist Federation during the period from 1900 to 1914. He was born on April 31, 1870, in Paraíba do Norte, but was created in the city of Recife. He defaced rio de Janeiro on the morning of July 31, 1941. From an early age, he proved to be a sharp pain in his studies and, favored by living intelligence, advanced, with real advantage, in his course of humanities. Financial difficulties forced him to drop his studies and enter trade when he was eleven years old. The merchants currently enjoy rights that, those of their time, were not granted. As soon as the dawn was emerging, until the dead of night, was the employee in active service. Only a small part of Sunday could the merchant breathe more freely and dispose of his will. However, he wanted the fate that our biographer, only of having a soul full of beautiful dreams, saw himself in the contingency of facing, as a boy, the struggles and the rude commercial discipline, thus sacrificing his most expensive ideals of intellectual formation.

It is not known whether, in coming here, by the year 1891, it already brought its belief in the Third Revelation. The right thing, however, is that in the midst of the blossoming of his youth, because he was about twenty-two years old, already alongside the unforgettable Bezerra de Menezes, worked so sincerely and enthusiastically for the sake of Spiritism, which, from the outset, earned the confidence of his confreres who suffraged him, in 1895, the name for Vice-President of the Brazilian Spiritist Federation.

The Brazilian Spirit is emerging on April 11, 1900, the poor, the little ones, the ignored had to face the fact that the Spirit of Adolfo Bezerra de Menezes, the great President of the Brazilian Spiritist Federation, had left for the regions sublimes from beyond.

It was, therefore, leopoldo Cirne who was the task of supreme direction of the House of Ishmael. And his performance in this high office was so remarkable that, for about fourteen years, he exercised it with true evangelical love and within that spirit of sincere humility that Christ gave us an uplifting example. Although at the beginning of his life he had been forced to interrupt his course of humanities, however, with his own effort, he managed Leopoldo Cirne to be one of the purest vernaculists, leaving us articles and works that to this day deserve our admiration.

To its persevering willpower and confidence in the mercy of alto, the Brazilian Spiritist Federation owes the headquarters on Avenida Passos, inaugurated on December 10, 1911.

He consecrated himself in the field of philosophical-religious literature as one of the great thinkers of the Spiritist Movement of the country, being even considered – the Brazilian Léon Denis.

I knew the Bible deeply and had many parts of Christ's Life in color. The best works of religion, philosophy, science, art and literature in general were familiar to him.

He translated several books into our language, including In the Invisible and Christianity and Spiritism, both by Léon Denis; and organized, in 1904, the opuscule Historical Memory of Spiritism.
