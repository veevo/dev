A Spirit that radiates tenderness and wisdom, awakening us to the experience of love at its highest 
expression, even if, in order to live it, we are imposed great sum of sacrifices. 
It is the Spirit that is known by the name Joanna of Angelas and who, on the roads of the centuries, 
we will meet her in the meek figure of Joan of Cusa, in a disciple of Francis of Assisi, in the great 
Soror Juana Inés de La Cruz and in the stillborn Joana Angelica de Jesus

Now know each of these characters who marked the story with their example of humility and heroism.

## Joan of Cusa 
Joana de Cusa, according to information from Humberto de Campos, in the book Boa Nova, was someone who possessed true faith. 
The author narrates that: Among the crowd that invariably accompanied JESUS in the folds of the lake, it was 
always a woman of rare dedication and noble character, of the most highly placed in capernaum society. 

It was Joana, consort of Cusa, intendant of Ântipas, in the city where vital interests were considered 
traders and fishermen.

Her husband, herod's senior official, did not share her wishes for spirituality, not tolerating the 
doctrine of that Master that Joan followed with admy. Poured to the weight of domestic injunctions, distressed 
by the misunderstanding and intolerance of the spouse, sought to hear the word of comfort of JESUS who, instead of inviting her 
thickening the ranks of those who followed Him through the streets and roads of Galilee, advised her to place him at a distance, 
serving Him within his own home, becoming a true example of a Christian person, in serving the next 
closer: her husband, whom she should serve with loving dedication, being faithful to God, loving the companion 
of the world as if his son was.

JESUS traced him a script of conduct that allowed him to live with resignation for the rest of his life.
He later became a mother.

Over time, the assignments were changing. The husband, after a tumultuous and untold life, passed away, leaving Joana without resources and with her son to raise. Brave, you sought to work. Forgetting "the comfort of material nobility, he dedicated himself to the children of other mothers, he was busy with the most subordinate household chores, so that his little boy had bread. He worked until old age.
Already old, with her hair bleached, was taken to the circus of martyrdoms, along with the young son, to witness the love for JESUS, the Master who had enlightened his life waving to him with hopes of a happy tomorrow.
Narrates Humberto de Campos, in the book quoted:
Before the voice of the people, the first scourges were ordered.
− Abjura!... − exclaims an executor of imperial orders, of cruel and gloomy gaze.
The ancient disciple of the Lord contemplates heaven, without a word of denial or grievance. Then the whip vibrates over the half-naked boy, who exclaims, between tears: − "Repudiate JESUS, my mother!... Can't you see we lost?! Abjura!... for me, that I am your son!..."
For the first time, from the martyr's eyes flows the abundant source of tears. The son's pleas are swords of anguish that rectalate his heart.
After remembering its entire existence, he replies:
"- Shut up, my son! JESUS was pure and did not damin the sacrifice. Let us know how to suffer at the painful time, because, above all the transitory happiness in the world, we must be faithful to GOD!"
Soon after, the flames consume their aged body, freeing it into the company of their Master, whom he knew how to serve and with whom he learned to sublimate love.

## Francisco of Assisi 
Centuries later, Francis the Poor Man of God, the Sun of Assisi, reorganizes King Galileo's Love Army; 
she also applies to living with him the simplicity of the Gospel of Jesus, which she loves and understands, 
chanting the song of universal brotherhood.

Soror Juana Inés de La Cruz 
In the 17th century, it reappears on the world stage, for another life dedicated to Good. It is reborn in 1651, in the tiny San Miguel Nepantla, about eighty kilometers from Mexico City, under the name juana de Asbaje Y Ramirez de Santillana, daughter of basque father and indigenous mother.

After 3 years of age, fascinated by the lyrics, to see her sister learn to read and write, deceives the teacher and tells her that her mother had asked her to literacy. The teacher, accustomed to the precocity of the child, who already answered the questions that her sister ignored, begins to teach him the first letters.

He started doing verses at the age of five.

At the age of 6, Juana perfectly dominated the pátrio language, as well as having sewing skills and other chores common to women of the time. I knew there was a University in Mexico and it was persoperated by the idea that in the future i could learn more and more among doctors. In conversation with his father, he confided his prospects for the future. Don Manuel, as a good Spaniard, laughed and said jokingly:

− Only if you dress up as a man, because there only rich boys can study. Juana was surprised by the novelty, and soon ran to her mother insistently asking her to dress as a man from now on, because she did not want, under any circumstances, to stay out of university.

In the Capital, at the age of 12, Juana learned Latin in 20 classes and Portuguese, alone. In addition, nahuatl spoke, an indigenous language. The Marquis de Mancera, wanting to create a brilliant court in European tradition, invited the 13-year-old prodigy girl to his wife's lady-in-waiting.

At the Court he charmed everyone with her beauty, intelligence and grace, becoming known and admired for his poetry, essays and humorous pieces. One day, the Viceroy decided to test the knowledge of the vivacious girl and gathered 40 experts from the University of Mexico to question her on the most diverse subjects. The audience watched, astonished, to that 15-year-old answering, for hours, the bombing of teachers' questions. And both the audience and the experts themselves applauded her, in the end, being pleased the Viceroy.

But his thirst for knowledge was stronger than the illusion of continuing to shine in court.

In order to devote himself more to his studies and penetrate deep into his inner world, in an unceasing search for union with the divine, eager to understand God through his creation, he decided to enter the Convent of the Descalças Carmelites at the age of 16. Unaccustomed to ascetic rigidity, he fell ill and returned to court. Following the guidance of his confessor, he went to the order of St. Jerome da Conceição, who has fewer religious obligations, being able to devote himself to letters and science. He took the name of Soror Juana Inés de La Cruz.

In her comfortable cell, surrounded by numerous books, terrestrial globes, musical and scientific instruments, Juana studied, wrote her poems, essays, dramas, religious pieces, Christmas carols and sacred music. She was often visited by European and New World intellectuals, exchanging knowledge and experiences.

The beautiful nun was known and admired by all, and her writings were popularized not only among religious, but also among students and masters of universities from various places. It was known as the Library Nun.

He was immortalized also for defending the woman's right to be intelligent, able to teach and preach freely.

In 1695, there was an epidemic of plague in the region. Juana rescued during the day and night her religious sisters who, along with most of the population, were sick. They were gradually dying one of their assisted and when there was no more religious, she, slaughtered and sick, overturned, at the age of 44.

## Soror Joan a Angelica de Jesus

After 66 years of her return to the Spiritual Homeland, he returned, now in the city of Salvador, Bahia, in 1761, as Joana Angélica, daughter of a wealthy family. At the age of 21, he entered the Convent of Lapa, as franciscan, with the name of Soror Joana Angelica de Jesus, making a profession as Sister of the Reformed Religious of Our Lady of Conception. She was a sister, clerk and vicar, when, in 1815, she became Abadessa and, on February 20, 1822, courageously defending the Convent, the house of Christ, as well as the honor of the young people who lived there, was murdered by soldiers fighting against the Independence of the Brazil.

In the divine plans, there was already a schedule for this life in Brazil, since before, when he reincarnated in Mexico as Sóror Juana Inés de La Cruz. Hence, its extreme ease to learn Portuguese. It is that, in Brazilian lands, they were reincarnated, and would soon reincarnate Spirits linked to it, souls committed to the Divine Law, who were part of their spiritual family and to whom they wished to help.

Among these fondness joanna de Ângelis, we highlight Amélia Rodrigues, educator, poet, novelist, playwright, speaker and contista who lived at the end of the last century to the beginning of this century.

## In Spirituality 
When, in the middle of the last century, "the powers of Heaven" were shaken, and a renewal movement 
spread across America and Europe, making the song of hope sound to the "four corners" with the 
revelation of immortal life, Joanna de Ângelis joined the Spirit of Truth team for the work 
implementation of Redivivo Christianity, the Comforter promised by Jesus.

And she, in the book After the Storm, in her last message, referring to the components of her team 
work says:

> When preparing the days of Spiritist Coding, when workers were called willing 
to the struggle, when the foresaid hours were announced, when seareiros were regimented to Earth, we listened 
the heavenly invitation and hurried to offer our sparse strength, as we ourselves, in order to serve, 
in the tiny condition of soil sulcators where the seeds of light of the Gospel of the Kingdom should fall.

In [The Gospel according to Spiritism](/books/gospel-according-spiritism), we will find two messages 
signed by A friendly Spirit. The first one at Cap. IX, item 7, with the title Patience, written in 
Havre, 1862. The second, in Cap. 18, items 13 and 15 entitled It will be given to the one who has, psychographed 
in the same year as the previous year, in the city of Bordeaux. If we look closely, we'll see the same Joanna who 
he writes to us today, dictating in the past a beautiful page, as the model of our attitudes, in any situation.

In the Spirit World, Joanna interned in a beautiful region near the Earth's Crust.

When several Spirits linked to it, deered ancient Christians prepared to reincarnate, he gathered 
to all and planned to build on Earth, under the sky of Bahia, in Brazil, a copy, although imperfect, of the 
Community where he interned in the Spiritual Plan, with the aim of, relinifying the ancient Christians, 
create an educational experience that demonstrated the feasibility of living in a community, really 
Christian, nowadays. Seriously ill spirits, not necessarily linked to their advisors 
incarnated, would come in conditions of orphans, providing opportunity for fraud, at the time when, 
themselves, they would release themselves from the most painful karmic injunctions and advancing towards Jesus.

Trained engineers were invited to outline the general contours of the work and instruct 
the pioneers of the future Work. When it was all sketched, Joanna sought to get in touch with 
Francisco de Assisi, requesting that you examine your plans and assist in the realization of them, in the Material Plan.

The Poor Little Man of God agreed with the Mentor and offered to collaborate with the Work, provided that in this 
Community was never to owe love the unfortunates of the world, or denied Charity to the 'Children of Calvary', 
nor if the presumption that is verrmine was established destroying the best buildings of moral feeling.'

Almost a century was spent, when the Lord's workers began materialization on earth in 1947 
of Joanna's plans, which inspired and guided, seconded by dedicated Spiritual Technicians who spread 
ozone special by the troubled psychosphere of the chosen region, where the Mansion of the Way would be built, 
name alluding to the House of the Way of early Christians.

In the meantime, the collaborators were reincarnating in different places, in different times, with 
varied instruction and diverse experiences to gradually, and when necessary, be "called" to meet the 
commitments made in the Spirituality. Not everyone, however, would reside in the Community, but from 
where they met, they would send their help, extend the gospel message, solidarity and vigilantes, 
linked to common work.

The growing institution always committed to assisting the suffering sains of the Earth, the ones listed 
in the trials, those who are one step away from madness and suicide.

Thanks to the activities developed, both materially and spiritually, with emergency therapy to newly 
disembodied and special care, the Mansion of the Way acquired a vibration of spirituality that supplants 
human vibrations of the who reside there and collaborate there.
