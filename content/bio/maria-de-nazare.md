Near the cross, Mary's agonized figure produced painful and indelible impression.\r

With anxious and tortured thinking, eyes fixed on the lumber of human perfidias, maternal tenderness regressed to the past in bitter memories.\r

There was, at extreme time, the well-loved son. Mary let herself go in the endless current of memories. These were the wonderful circumstances in which the birth of Jesus had been announced to him, the friendship of Elizabeth, the prophecies of old Simeon, recognizing that God's assistance had become undisputed in the smallest details of his life. At that supreme moment, he resaw the manger, in her harsh beauty, feeling that Nature seemed to wish to tell her ears the singing of glory of that unforgettable night. Through the thick veil of tears, passed, one by one, the childhood scenes of the shudder shudder, observing the inner alarm of the sweetest reminiscences.\r

In the smallest things, he recognized the intervention of heavenly Providence; however, at that time, his thought also wandered through the vast sea of the most distressing questions.\r

What had Jesus do for deserving so bitter sorrows? Don't you turn him up with immaculate feelings, under the warmth of his heart? From the tenderest years, when he led him to the traditional source of Nazareth, he observed the fraternal affection that compensated all creatures. He often picked him up on the cobbled streets, where his affectionate word comforted helpless and sad passers-by. Misérrimos viandantes came to his modest house to praise the idolized little boy, who knew how to distribute the blessings of Heaven. With what I enlevo received the unexpected guests that his tiny hands led to Joseph's carpentry!... She remembered well that one day the divine child had guided the house two evildoers publicly recognized as thieves of the Mizhep valley.\r

And one would see the loving concern with which his little figure took care of the unknown, as if they were his brothers. He had often commented on the excellence of that sanctified virtue, fearing for the future of his lovely little boy.\r

After the caricious domestic environment, it was the heavenly mission, dilating in harvesting wonderful fruits. They were paralyzed who resumed the movements of life, blind who reintegrated into the sacred gifts of sight, starving creatures of light and love that sated in their lesson of infinite goodness.\r

What deep designs had led his beloved son to the cross of the torment?\r

A friendly voice spoke to the Spirit, saying of God's unsonorable and righteous determinations, which need to be accepted for the divine redemption of creatures.\r

His heart burst into storms of irrepressible tears; however, in the sanctuary of conscience, he repeated his statement of sincere humility: "Make in slave the will of the Lord!"\r

With a distressed soul, he noticed that Jesus had reached the last limit of the inenarrable sufferings. Some of the most exalted people multiplied the blows, while the spears scratched the air, in audacious and sinister threats. Scathing ironies were uttered to moosm, tearing him the sensitive and affectionate soul.\r

Among some compadecidawomen, who accompanied her the distressed trance, Mary noticed that someone had laid her hands, lightly, on her shoulders.\r

He was faced with the figure of John who, overcoming the criminal pusilanimity in which the other companions had dipped, stretched his loving and recognized arms. Silently, Zebedeou's son embraced that crushed maternal heart. Mary let herself be entangled by the dear disciple and both, at the foot of the wood, in a supplication gesture, eagerly sought the light of those merciful eyes, at the height of torments. It was there that the forehead of the divine supplication moved slowly, revealing the anxiety of those two souls at a dismay.\r

"My son! My beloved son!" exclaimed the martyr, in distress at the serenity of that untranslatable melancholy gaze.\r

Christ seemed to meditate at the height of his pains, but as if he wanted to demonstrate, in the final instant, the greatness of his courage and his perfect communion with God, he replied with significant movement of the watchful eyes:\r

"Mother, here's your son!" And addressing, in a special way, with a slight nod to the apostle, he said:\r

"Son, here's your mother!"\r

Mary became involved in the veil of her painful weeping, but the great evangelist understood that the Master, in his final lesson, taught that universal love was the sublime crowning of his work. He understood that in the future the clarity of the Kingdom of God would reveal to men the need for the cessation of all selfishness and that, in the sanctuary of every heart, there should be the most abundant quota of love, not only for the family circle, but also for all needy in the world, and that in the temple of each dwelling would remain the royal brotherhood, so that reciprocal assistance would take place on earth, without the need for the outer buildings, consecrated to a claudicant solidarity.\r

For a long time, they remained there, in silent prayers, until the Master, exanime, was torn to the cross, before the storm plunged the punished landscape of Jerusalem into a flood of shadows.\r

After the separation of the disciples, who dispersed through different places, for the diffusion of the Good News, Mary retired to Bataneia, where some close relatives waited for her with special affection.\r

The years began to roll, silent and sad, to the anguished longing of his heart.\r

Touched by great displeasures, he noted that, in quick time, the memories of the beloved son became elements of rough discussions among his followers. In Bataneia, it was intended to maintain a certain spiritual aristocracy, due to the consanguineous bonds that held it there, by virtue of the links that connected it to Joseph. In Jerusalem, Christians and Jews were divided, with vehemence and acrimony. In Galilee, nature's ancient simple and amorble upper room were sad and deserted.\r

For that loving mother, whose dignified soul observed that Cana's generous wine had become the vinegar of martyrdom, time always marked a greater longing in the world and an ever-increasing hope in heaven.\r

His life was an unceasing devotion to the immense rosary of longing, to the dearest memories. All that the happy past had built in his inner world relived on the canvas of his memories, with only known minutiae of love, and nourished him with the sap of life.\r

He recalled his little Jesus, as on that night of prodigious beauty, in which he had received it in his maternal arms, illuminated by the sweetest mystery.\r

He was also shown to listen to the blunder of the sheep that came, hurried to approach the cradle that had formed impromptu.\r

What about that first kiss, made of affection and light? The reminiscences involved the distant reality of singular beauties for his sensitive and generous heart. Then it was the river of memories flowing, without ceasing, in its soul rich in sentimentality and tenderness. Nazareth returned to his imagination, with his landscapes of happiness and light. The simple house, the friendly fountain, the sincerity of affections, the majestic lake and, in the midst of all the details, the beloved son, working and loving, in the eruption of God's highest conception among the men of the earth. From time to time, he seemed to see him in his dreams full of hope. Jesus promised him the charming joy of his presence and participated in the caress of his memories.\r

At this time, the son of Zebedee, bearing in mind the observations that the Master had made to him of the cross, appeared in Batanoea, offering that late spirit of mother the loving refuge of his protection. Mary accepted the offering, with immense satisfaction.\r

And John told him his new life. It had definitely settled in Ephesus, where Christian ideas gained ground among devoted and sincere souls. He had never looked at the Lord's recommendations and, in the heart, kept that title of sonship as one of the highest expressions of universal love towards the one who had received the Master in the venerable and caring arms. Mary listened to her confidences, in a mixture of recognition and perhaps.\r

John continued to expose his most insignificant plans to him. I'd take it with you, you'd both walk in the same association of spiritual interests. It would be his unveiled son, while realing maternal tenderness from his generous soul in the work of the Gospel. It was long before he came, explained zebedeous's son, because he lacked a poplar, where they could take shelter; however, one of the members of adiabene's royal family, converted to christ's love, had donated to him a poor little house south of Ephesus, distancing three leagues about the city. The simple and poor dwelling took a long time in a headland, from where the sea was sighted. At the top of the small hill, far from men and on the imposing altar of Nature, they would gather both to cultivate the permanent remembrance of Jesus. They would establish a landing and refuge to the helpless, teach the truths of the Gospel to all spirits of good will, and, as a mother and son, they would begin a new age of love in the universal community.\r

Mary happily accepted.\r

In a short time, they settled in nature's friend boon, in front of the ocean. Ephesus was a little distant; however, all adjacencies were populated with new nuclei of joyful and modest dwellings. John's house, after a few weeks, became a point of lovely assemblies, where the memories of the Messiah were worshipped by humble and sincere spirits.\r

Mary was externalabout her memories. He spoke of him with maternal burial, while the apostle commented on gospel truths, enjoying the teachings received. Numerous times, the meeting only ended high night, when the stars had greater brightness. And it wasn't just. After a few months, large ranks of needy rushed to the simple and generous site. The news that Mary rested, now, among them, had spread a flash of hope for all the sufferers. While John preached in the city the truths of God, she attended, in the poor domestic sanctuary, to those who sought her by displaying her ulcers and needs.\r

His poplar was then known by the name "Casa da Santíssimo".\r

The fact had come on one occasion when a wretched leper, after being relieved in his wounds, osculed his hands, admittedly murmuring:\r

"Madam, you are the mother of our Master and our Most Holy Mother!"\r

Tradition has taken root in all spirits. Who didn't owe you the favor of a motherly word in the toughest moments? And John consolidated the concept, stressing that the world would be eternally grateful to him, for it was for its spiritual greatness that the Emissary of God could penetrate the dark and pestilent atmosphere of the world to balsamize the creature's sufferings. In her sincere humility, Mary dodged the affectionate tributes of Jesus' disciples, but that filial trust with which she was told the presence was for her soul a bland and delicious treasure of the heart. The title of motherhood made the sweetest songs vibrate in his spirit. Every day, the helpless ones were taking place, pleading for their spiritual assistance. They were old trôpegos and deceived of the world, who came to hear the comforting and affectionate words, sick who invoked their protection, unfortunate mothers who asked for the blessing of their affection.\r

"My mother, i said one of the most afflicted, how can I overcome my difficulties? I feel abandoned on the dark road of life."\r

Mary sent her the loving gaze of her kindness, letting in him show all the enternecidal dedication of her maternal spirit.\r

"It also passes!" she said affectionately, "only the Kingdom of God is strong enough never to pass from our souls, as eternal realization of heavenly love."\r

His concepts slowed the pain of the most desperate, unwindled the dark thinking of the most cherished.\r

The church of Ephesus demanded of John the highest expression of personal sacrifice, so over time, Mary was almost always alone, when the humble legion of the needy descended the unataviated promontory, towards the most comforted and happy homes. The days and weeks, months and years passed incessantly, bringing him the most tender memories. When serene and bluish, the sea made him return to memory the distant Tiberíades. He surprised in the air those vague perfumes that filled the soul of the afternoon, when his son, from whom not a moment was forgotten, bringing together the beloved disciples, transmitted to the hearts of the people the dishes of the Good News. Old age had neither tiredness nor bitterness. The certainty of divine protection provided him with uninterrupted comfort.\r

As those who transpose the day into honest and fruitful labor, their hearts experienced grateful rest, illuminated by the moonlight of hope and the shining stars of immorredoura belief. His meditations were gentle colloquia with the reminiscences of the much-loved son.\r

Suddenly, he received news that a period of painful persecution had opened to all who were faithful to the doctrine of his divine Jesus. Some Christians banished from Rome brought Ephesus with sad information. In obedience to the most unjust edicts, the followers of Christ were enslaved, their homes were destroyed, ironing them in prisons. There was talk of public parties, in which their bodies were given as food to insatiable beasts, in horrendous spectacles.\r

Then, in a starry twilight, Mary gave herself to prayers, as usual, asking God for all those who found themselves in anguish of the heart, for the sake of her son.\r

Although the soleity of the environment, he did not feel alone: one as a singular force bathed his whole soul. Soft aragens blew from the ocean, spreading the aromas of the night that was populated with friendly and affectionate stars and, in a few minutes, the full moon also participated in this concert of harmony and light.\r

Taken in her meditations, Mary saw the figure of a beggar approach. "My mother!" exclaimed the newcomer, like so many others who resorted to his affection—, "I come to keep you company and receive your blessing."\r

Maternally, she invited him in, impressed with that voice that inspired her deep sympathy. The pilgrim spoke to him from heaven, comforting her delicately. He commented on the divine beatitudes awaiting all the devoted and sincere children of God, implying that he understood his most tender homesickness. Maria was excited by a touching surprise. What beggar would be the one who calmed his secret pains of the late soul, with so sweet balms? None had come up to him until then to give; it was always to ask for something. However, that unknown viandante poured into his heart the holiest consolations. Where have you heard in other times that sweet and caring voice?! What emotions were those that made him pulsate the heart of so much caress? His eyes were deared with ventura, without being able to explain the reason for his emotional suit. That's when the anonymous guest held out his generous hands and spoke to him with a deep love accent:\r

"My mother, come to my arms!"\r

At that moment, he looked at the noble hands he offered, in a gesture of the most beautiful tenderness. Taking deep commotion, he saw in them two wounds, such as the ones his son revealed on the cross and instinctively directing the anxious gaze to the feet of the pilgrim friend, also shared there the ulcers caused by the carnations of the torment. You couldn't do it anymore. Understanding the loving visit that God sent to his heart, he cried with infinite joy:\r

"My son! my son! the ulcers they made you!. . ."\r

And rushing to him, as a loving and unveiled mother, she wanted to make sure, touching the wound produced by her last pitch, near the heart.\r

His tender and helpful hands embraced him in the shadow visited by the moonlight, suffering the ulcer that had caused him to maternal affection. The side chaga was also there, under the caress of his hands. He couldn't master his intense joy. In an impulse of love, he made a move to kneel. He wanted to embrace at the feet of his Jesus and to wrest them with tenderness. He, however, lifting her, surrounded by a halo of heavenly light, knelt at his feet and, kissing his hands, said in affectionate transport:\r

"Yes, my mother, it's me!... I come to get you, for my Father wants you to be in my kingdom the Queen of Angels. . . .\r

Mary staggered, taken from inexpressible ventura. I wanted to say your happiness, to express your thanks to God; but the body as if it had paralyzed him, while to his ears came the gentle echoes of the Angel's greeting, which were to sing a thousand charitable voices, through the harmonies of heaven.\r

The other day, two humble bearers descended from Ephesus, from where they returned with John, to watch the last moments of what was devoted to them Most Holy Mother.\r

Maria didn't talk. In an unforgettable expression of serenity, for long hours still waited for the rupture of the final bonds that held it to material life.\r

The dawn unfolded its beautiful range of light when that chosen soul rose from earth, where he had so often cried with joy, longing and hope.\r

I no longer saw your beloved son, who would certainly expect her with the welcome in his kingdom of love; but, extensive crowds of angelic entities surrounded her singing glorification hymns.\r

Experiencing the feeling of moving away from the world, he wished to review Galilee with its favorite places. It was enough to demonstrate her will for them to lead her to the lake region of Genesaré, of wonderful beauty. He reviewed all the paintings of his son's apostolate and, only now, observing from above the landscape, he noticed that the Tiberíades, in its gentle contours, presented the almost perfect shape of a lute. It was recalled, then, that in that instrument of Nature Jesus had sung the most beautiful poem of life and love, in honor of God and humanity. Those meek waters, daughters of the sailor and calm Jordan, had been the sound strings of the gospel chant.\r

Sweet joys invaded his heart and already the spiritual caravan was set out, when Mary remembered the disciples persecuted for the cruelty of the world and wished to embrace those who would stand in the valley of shadows, waiting for the definitive clarity of the Kingdom of God. By emitting this thought, he gave new impetus to the spiritual crowds that followed it closely. In a few moments, his gaze was in a superb and wonderful city, scattered over car-adorned hills and monuments that caused him astonishment. The richest marbles skewed on the magnificent public roads, where patrician litters passed without ceasing, displaying stonestores and fur, sustained by misérrimos slaves.\r

A few more moments and his gaze discovered another iron-guarded crowd in dark dungeons. The dark prisons of the Esquilino penetrated, where hundreds of bitter faces depicted atrocious sufferings. The condemned experienced in their hearts an unknown consolation.\r

Mary approached one by one, participated in her anguish, and prayed with her prayers, full of suffering and trust. She felt mother to that assembly of tortured by the injustice of the world. He spread the merciful clarity of his Spirit among those pale and sad physiognomies. They were ancients who trusted Christ, women who had despised the comfort of home for him, young people who deposed in the Gospel of the Kingdom all their hope. Mary relieved their hearts and, before leaving, sincerely wished to leave them in the downcast Spirits. What did you have to give them? Should I plead with God for freedom?! But Jesus had taught that with him every yoke is soft and every burden would be light, looking better to slavery with God than false freedom in the unvãos of the world. He recalled that his son had left the strength of prayer as an unascounterly power among the beloved disciples. Then he begged Heaven to give him the possibility of leaving among oppressed Christians the power of joy. That's when, approaching a young incarcerated, with a scarnated and macilent face, she told her in her ear:\r

> "Sing, my daughter! Let's get good cheer!... We turn our earth's pains into joys for Heaven!"\r

The sad prisoner would never know how to understand why the emotionality that suddenly made her heart vibrate. With ecstatic eyes, contemplating the luminous firmament, through the powerful grids, ignoring the reason for his joy, sang a hymn of deep and enternecido love for Jesus, in which he reflected his gratitude for the pains sent to him, transforming all his bitterness in consoling rhymes of joy and hope. Then moments ago, his melodious singing was accompanied by the hundreds of voices of those who wept in prison, awaiting glorious testimony.\r

Soon, the majestic caravan led to the Kingdom of the Master the blessed among women and, since that day, in the harshest torments, Jesus' disciples have sung on earth, expressing their good cheer and joy, keeping the soft heritage of our Most Holy Mother.\r

For this reason, my brothers, when you hear the song in the temples of the various religious families of Christianity, do not forget to make a soft silence in your hearts, so that the Mystical Rose of Nazareth spreads its scent there!\r

Note\r
This is not a biography of Mary's life, but an account of Humberto de Campos made about the culminating moments of her existence, that the Bible does not bring any information.\r
