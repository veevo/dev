I see in the attitude of dear Mother Teresa an antidote against human
selfishness: "Share whatever we have (love, food, affection, sweater,
attention...) it's an act of humanity.

But authentic love for someone requires commitment, faithfulness, and give
yourself.  Teresa did not "feel" the love of Christ and sought God's answer all
the time, and could have stopped everything for it, but it got up at 4:30 a.m.
every morning for Jesus and i was able to write to him: Your happiness is the
only thing I want.  This is a powerful example, and let's remember that she
preached first love, not religion."

In a world where selfishness prevails we have the rich opportunity to admire the
work and know a little of a being who infected with his immense love.

Love, true love that makes humility an instrument to help the least favored by
life. Mother Tereza is our mirror we can say our idol, we have deep admiration
for this being blessed by GOD. Who worried, more than that, he took care to make
his journey the light that illuminates and comforts the hearts suffered, with
such generosity and love giving.

On August 27, 1910, a special day agnese Gonxha Bojaxhin was born nothing more
nothing less than Mother Tereza of Calcutta in Skopje, Albanian city of Kossovo
that a few years later, it would pass into yugoslavia. The girl came to the
world in a Catholic family, happy and wealthy.

His father Nicola Bojaxhiu, a prosperous merchant graduated from His Mother's
Pharmacy Drone, a beautiful young woman. They had 3 children, Lazar, Ágata and
Agnese (Mother Teresa) who was called by the family "Gonxha" that in Albanian
means "button Flower."

Agnese (MotherTeresa) followed the life of a religious influenced by priests of
the Region.

She joined the Order of Our Lady of Loreto at the age of 18.As a nun adopted the
name of Mother Tereza de Calcutta.

Went to a Monastery in Dublin, Ireland from there sent to India, in the city
calcutta, where he wore the habit in 1928.  In 1931, he began teaching well-born
children teaching classes of History and Geography, following the motto:
"Educate the upper class, which in turn will teach Christian life to the poor"

In 1934, she casts perpetual vows in the Congregation and became Director of the
university cani.

In October 1946, when witnessing, during a train journey, the mixture of men and
curged, extremely dirty and unpleasantly odored, while following the Mother
Teresa's journey, tried to seek an answer in her religious principles an
explanation for so much pain. I wasn't bothered by the presence of those poor
people, although accustomed to the perfect cleanliness and hygiene of the St.
Mery's School, where her students were always well dressed and Scented.

After rigorous reflection, Mother Teresa who has always been very disciplined
and prudent, he was not carried away by enthusiasm. But he knew deep in his soul
that would have a mission to accomplish. That after that trip your life would
change Radically. It would have a long and difficult way to go. But I was sure
that God would give you the strength and faith to carry forward his mission.
After complying with all legal procedures and legal arrangements obtained
permission to live outside the convent. And by realizing that he could fulfill
his mission in a way that decided to drop out of classes to devote himself
exclusively to poor, watching closely the sufferings of brothers less wealthy,
the wretched.  ON August 16, 1948, Mother Teresa leaves the habit of a nun and
abandons the Convent.

One day Mother Tereza found a half-dead baby in the trash.  He applied
mouth-to-mouth breathing. They told him the child was dead.  But she did not
give up and when the baby gave a sign of life, she squeezed him against his
chest and shouted, "He's alive!" And he took him home.

He infected many with his immense love...  A couple came to her and handed her a
large sum of money.  They told him they'd been married two days ago. They
decided not to wear nuptials or celebration and brought him the money that would
be spent on the Wedding. We loved her very much and thought it would be
beautiful to share our love with the poor you serve.  There was a period in
Calcutta that there were sugar scabies, spread through the city that Mother
Teresa had no sugar for her orphans. One night it's here a couple with their
six-year-old son he brought a bottle in his hands. By a week had refused to eat
sugar so he could give it to the less fortunate What is it.

A gentleman arrived with his little son. I told him the boy liked it so much
decided to keep the allowance to give as a gift to the poor. He'd stayed so
touched by the attitude of the son, who had decided to quit smoking and drink a
month the economy was destined for it.

Some Japanese Buddhists learned that the congregation of Mother Tereza fasted
every first Friday of the month, to allocate that economy to the poor.  They
imitated their gesture had the attitude of sending her the result of their
Collection. With this importance in cash was built the first floor of the house
that aimed at harboring girls and women freed from prison.

Mother Tereza always emphasized the value and power of prayer, saying: If we
pray we will be able to love, and if we love we will be able to serve. Pray as a
child. You must address GOD as a child. A child has no difficulty in expressing
what you think of simple words, which say a lot. If a child has not yet been
distorted and has not yet learned to lie, she will say All. It is only
necessary, that little elevation of mind to God

"I love you, God I trust you, I need you now" He also said: "That we should all
help a Hindu, become a Hindu Better. A Muslim, becoming a better Muslim. A
Catholic to be a catholic so on with other religions."

What she means is that we turn theory into practice we put love above all else,
because only love transforms.  Everything we do with love will bear good fruit.

When he saw the doors of the convents closed to his back he experienced a deep
sense of disorientation, found herself alone in the streets of Calcutta, was
taken by anguish, alone without home, money, work without knowing where Sleep.
He had only the Pope's permission to live temporarily outside the convent, to
found a new religious congregation. He moved to Patna to take a nursing course,
attended the course for four months, where he learned what they generally teach
themselves in a year.

December 25, 1948, Mother Teresa officially begins her new mission to service of
the poorest among the poor, date that she had chosen because it is birthday of
Christ.

Arriving in Calcutta went to visit a slum he knew, Motijhil, to fraternize on
Christmas Day with women and children. You've searched for a place to live. A
woman rented her a very poor hut for five rupees per Month. That was your first
home. The next morning, the voice of Mother Teresa teaching five children the
first letters of the alphabet Bengali. In the room there was no furniture or
blackboard. With a wand the Mother wrote the letters on the dirt floor.

Until a few months before Mother Teresa was the director of the celebrated High
School side of the slum where she was now.

And so it all started. With the help of former students from wealthy families.
Since then he has gone on to collect beggars, sick, abandoned children,
alcoholics, alcoholics old, aideticos and recover ex-convicts. Won notoriety
worldwide for his work, which began without financial support, but with help
from Indian girls. They took four votes: poverty, charity, obedience and the
main of them, compassion. Wearing only Indian saris and Sandals.  The Order of
Missionaries of Charity was founded in l950.  In 1952 Mother Teresa founded her
first major social work in Nirmal

"House of the Dying" Although difficult the path he chose, fought with the armed
love and with great determination eventually won. There were times when she
thought of giving up due to persecution, for many do not understand the nobility
of the spirit of those who dedicate themselves of body and soul to humanity.
Certain made in one of his meditations wrote:

> "My God, by free choice and for Your love, I wish to stay here and make the
that Your will requires from me. No! I'm not going back. . My community are the
poor. Your safety is mine. Your health is mine. My home is the home of the poor.
Not just the poor, but the poorest of the poor.  Those of whom people no longer
want to approach, afraid of contagion and dirt, because they are covered in
microbes and worms. Of those who won't pray in temples, because they cannot
leave home naked. Of those who no longer eat because they don't have the
strength to eat. Of those who fall down the streets, aware that they will die
and next to which the living pass, without Watch. Of those who no longer cry,
because they have exhausted their Tears. Of the untouchables."

Biography Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu, born On August 26, 1910, in Skopje, Macedonia,
daughter of Albanian parents, in a family of three children, two young women and
one Boy. Although she was born on August 26, she considered august 27, the day
he was baptized, like her "true birthday." He went to a non-Catholic school.  He
began by vowing at the age of 18 in the Sisters of Our Lady of Loreto (Blessed
Virgin Mary Institute) in Ireland, where she lived for a short time.

## Serving the world
In India, at the service of this congregation as a teacher, at the first home
"Sishi Bavan" (House of Hope), founded in 1952, joined the
"Home of the Dying" in Kalighat. At first, she had some problems of
religious order, with some groups professing another faith, and
consequently, another religion and culture, but over time,
all were noticing, that she had really good intentions, and that her work
had truly a noble character. So she begins to receive donations
hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, etc. And so it was also happening in relation to
other difficult and problematic situations, such as: abandoned children,
aidaetics, women who had been abused and became pregnant, lepers...

More than a decade later, in 1965, the Holy See approved the Congregation
Missionaries of Charity and, between 1968 and 1989, established their presence
in countries such as Albania, Russia, Cuba, Canada, Palestine,
Bangladesh, Australia, U.S.A., Sri Lanka| Ceylon, Italy,
former Soviet Union, China, etc.

The recognition of the world for his work came true with the
Templeton in 1973 and the Nobel Peace Prize on October 17, 1979.
He died in 1997 at the age of 87 of a heart attack while preparing a service
in memory of Princess Diana of Wales, her great friend and deceased
herself six days earlier in a car accident in Paris. Treated as a
state funeral, several were the representatives of the world who wanted to be
gifts to pay his respects. Televisions from all over the world
broadcast live for a week, the millions who wanted to see her in the
Netaji stadium. It is buried in Motherhouse Convent, Kolkata, Bengal
West in India. On October 19, 2003, Pope John Paul II
blessed Mother Teresa.

Her missionary work continues through Sister Nirmala, elected on the 13th
of March 1997 as its successor.
One of his thoughts was this: "Let us not use bombs or weapons to conquer the
World. Let us use love and compassion. Peace begins with a smile." Created the
missionaries of charity, where all the nuns would help not her, but rather
to all those in need. All registered.

Mother Teresa's "dark night"
A collection of letters addressed to a few spiritual counselors and
collected in the book "Mother Teresa come, be my light" (Mother Teresa: Eats
Be My Light) published on September 4, 2007, translated and published in
Brazil pela editor Thomas Nelson, organized hair Father Brian Kolodiejchuk,
postulator of the cause of its canonization revealed, according to some, doubts
mother Teresa's faith in God, provoking discussions about a
possible agnostic position.

Mother Teresa, in her letters, described how she lacked Answers from God.
In 1956 he wrote: "So deep eagerness for God - and ... revulsion -- empty -- no faith
- no love - no fervor. Souls does not attract - Heaven means nothing - pray for
me so that I may keep smiling at Him after all." In 1959: "If you do not
there is God -- there can be no soul -- if there is no soul then, Jesus -- You
it's also not real."

One of his letters to Father Neuner read: "For the first time over 11
years -- I came to love darkness. - Because now I believe it's part, part of it
very, very small of Jesus' darkness and pain in this world. The Lord
taught me to accept it [as] a 'spiritual side of her work', as he wrote.
- Today I have really felt a profound joy - that Jesus can no longer go through the
agony -- but who wants to pass me. - I abandon him more than ever. -
Yes - more than I will ever be available."

However, the text of your letters should not affect the campaign for your
sanctification, as the Church argues that other Saints have also demonstrated
doubts about his faith, such as St Thomas.

## The spiritual crisis
According to the postulator of the cause of the canonization of Mother Teresa and author of the book,
their spiritual crisis began in the 1950s, shortly after the founding of the order of
Missionaries of Charity; from there "lived a great phase of darkness
that has lasted until his death." "I knew I was united with God, but
could not feel anything"[4] This phenomenon is known in tradition and
Christian mystical theology, and it was St John of the Cross who called him dark night
of the spirit, which considers a step in the way of some saints on the path
identification with God.
Divine silence.

Benedict XVI commenting on the letters said that this silence serves so that the
believers realize the situation of those who do not believe in God. Talking about
the mystical experiences of the blessed said that "everything we already knew was
now shows even more openly: with all his charity, his strength of
faith, Mother Teresa suffered from the silence of God."

## Antidote against sentimentality.
Kolodiejchuk sees in the attitude of beata an antidote against sentimentality:
"The trend in our spiritual life, and also in the most general attitude
in relation to love, is that what counts are our feelings. Thus the
totality of love is what we feel. But authentic love for someone requires the
commitment, fidelity and vulnerability. Mother Teresa did not "feel" the love of
Christ, and could have cut, but he would get up at 4:30 a.m. each morning by Jesus
and I was able to write to him: Your happiness is the only one I want. This is a
powerful example, including in non-purely religious terms."

Deus Caritas East
Benedict XVI in his encyclical God caritas est, of 25 December 2005, "on
Christian love", quotes Mother Teresa as an example of a person of prayer and at the same time
operative time of faith:

Piety does not loosen the fight against poverty or even against the misery of
Next. Blessed Teresa of Calcutta is a very evident example of the fact that the
time dedicated to God in prayer not only does not harm the effectiveness or operosity of the
love of others, but it is really his inexhaustible source. In your letter to the
Lent of 1996, this blessed wrote to her lay collaborators: 'We
we need this intimate union with God in our everyday life. And how
can we get it? Through prayer. [7]

## Beatification and canonization

occurred with Monica Besra, an Indian woman, who was cured of a stomach tumor
inexplicable manner and whose cure was attributed to Mother Teresa. It's open
