Johann Pestalozzi was born in Zurich, Switzerland, in 1746 and died in 1827.

He exerted great influence on educational thinking and was a great supporter of
public education.

Democratized education, proclaiming that it is the absolute right of every child
to have fully developed the powers given by God. His enthusiasm forced rulers to
be interested in the education of children in the Disadvantaged. We can say that
he psychologicalized education, because when there was still the structuring of
a psychological science and although its knowledge of the nature of the human
mind were vague, clearly saw that a correct theory and practice of education
should be based on such a type of Knowledge.

In 1782, in his first book: Leonardo and Gertrudes, he expressed his ideas
educational education, but the work was not considered as an educational
treatise by the important figures of the time.

Pestalozzi decides to be a master-school, and then goes, at his school, to seek
apply your educational ideas. For him the school should approach a
well-organized house, for the home was the best educational institution, the
basis for moral, political and religious formation.  In his school, teachers and
students (boys and adolescents ) remained together the all day, sleeping in
ordinary rooms.

School organization: • The classes were formed with children under eight years
of age, with students among eight and eleven years and another class aged eleven
to eighteen years.  • School activities lasted from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. and
were developed flexibly; students prayed, bathed, made the breakfast, they did
the first lessons, with a short interval between They.  • Two afternoons a week
were free, and students toured.  • Disciplinary problems were discussed at
night; he condemned the coertion, rewards and punishments.

Educational situation in force while Pestalozzi introduced his reforms
Educational:

The church controlled virtually every school and there were no concerns about
quality improvement; privileged classes despised the people, the teachers had no
qualification, there were very few school buildings and educational emphasis was
given to memory. The Swiss revolution that occurred in 1799 had released the
disadvantaged class and, according to Pestalozzi, only education could
contribute to the people retaining the rights they have earned, this is,
education could change the terrible living condition of the people.

Educational Principles and Contributions of Pestalozzi

  • Development is organic, and the child develops by laws defined; gradation
  must be respected; the method must follow nature; sensory impression is
  fundamental and the senses should be in contact direct with objects; the mind
  is active; the teacher is compared to the gardener who measures the conditions
  conducive to the growth of Plants.  • Belief in education as the supreme means
  for individual improvement and social.  • Rationale for organic development
  education more than in transmission of memoryable ideas.  • Education begins
  with the perception of concrete objects and consequently with the realization
  of concrete actions and the experimentation of responses real emotional.  •
  Development is a gradual acquisition, each form of instruction must be
  progress slowly and gradually.  • Conceptualization of discipline based on
  mutual goodwill and cooperation between student and teacher.  • Introduction
  of new methodological features.  • Boosted teacher training and the study of
  education as a Science.


Pestallozzi and his team elaborate pedagogical materials, focused on language,
Mathematics, science, geography, history and music. And so he states: (Apud:
SEE-RJ - http://www.riojaneiro.rj.gov.br/rio.html)

> "Education builds itself in a permanent tension between man's desires
development of universal human nature. Education produce universality from
particularities and in the same way to particularity from universality."
