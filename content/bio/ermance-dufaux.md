Ermance De La Jonchére Dufaux was born in 1841 in the town of Fontainebleau,
France. Near Paris, it housed the official residence of Napoleon III and other
Noble. Ermance's father, a wealthy producer of wine and wheat, was one of them. Traditional
the Dufaux family resided in a medieval castle, heritage of their ancestors.

In 1853, the Dufaux's daughter began to present unsettling imbalance
nervous and to make premonitions. Because of this problem, his father sought out the famous
doctor Cléver De Maldigny.

From Mr. Dufaux's account, the doctor said Ermance appeared to be suffering
of a new nervous disorder, which had made several victims in America and who,
now, i was coming to Europe. Victims of the disease entered a kind of
hysterical trance and began to receive hypothetical messages from beyond.

The doctor advised Mr. Dufaux to bring Ermance to his office, the most
possible fast. That's how it was done. A few days later, the young lady attended the
Inquiry.

Maldigny put a pencil in the girl's hand and asked her to write what
was driven by him. Ermance began to laugh, joking, but suddenly his
arm took his own life and began to write alone. When you see yourself dominated by
a strange force, Ermance frightened himself, dropped his pencil and did not want to continue to
Experience.

Maldigny examined the paper and confirmed his diagnosis. Ermance's parents
were extremely concerned. As the family was famous in court, the news
soon spread in Paris and Fontainebleau, reaching the ears of the Marquis of
Mirvile, famous scholar of Magnetism.

The Marquis visited the Castle of the Dufaux and asked to examine Ermance. The
parents made it agood, but the young lady had to be convinced. Finally, Ermance
put himself in a position to write and Mirvile asked the invisible:
- Is the Spirit I think of? If so, please write your name
through the girl.
Ermance's hand began to move and wrote:
- No, but one of your remote relatives.
Can you write your name?
- I'd rather my name comes directly to your head. Think about it for a second.
- Saint Louis, king of France (1), cousin of the first nobleman of my family?
Yes, I myself.
- Can Your Majesty give me proof that he is really our great king?
- No one in this house knows that you and your relatives consider me the Angel of
Family guard.

If Maligny saw Ermance's case as illness, the Marquis also had his
preconceived explanations. In her opinion, she only captured the ideas and
thoughts present in the environment. That's at best. At worst, the young
was being interpreter of the Devil, for, as a Catholic, he did not believe that the
dead could communicate. A conclusive analysis should be carried out by the
Paris Academy of Sciences.

Mr. Dufaux, however, did not take the case forward. Although it was also
catholic, he preferred to believe that his daughter was not sick or possessed, but only
an intermediary between the living and the dead. The family was getting used to the
ermance's college came to be seen as a natural and positive thing.
Contacts with São Luís became frequent. Under her influx, she
wrote the posthumous autobiography of the canonized king, entitled "The story of Louis
IX, dictated by himself." In 1854, this text was published in a book, but the
Censorship of the Government of Napoleon III prohibited its distribution. The censors found
whereas some passages could be understood as critical of the Emperor and the Church.
The favorable positioning of dufaux to neo-spiritualism (spiritualisme)
generated retaliation. In a confession, Ermance refused to deny his belief in the
Spirits, attributing their messages to Satan, and was forbidden to commune. The
Empress also cooled her relationship with the family. However, the
Emperor Napoleon III was curious and asked to meet Miss Dufaux.
She was welcomed at fontainebleau palace and received a message from
Napoleon Bonaparte to his nephew. The message answered a mental question
by Louis Napoleon and his style corresponded exactly to that of Bonaparte.
Over time, the Spirits also began to speak for Ermance. In 1855,
at the age of 14, Ermance publishes his second book "spiritualiste" (at the time, not
there were spiritist terms, mediumship, etc.). The first to be distributed and
sold: "The story of Joan of Arc, dictated by herself" (Editora Meluu, Paris).
According to Canuto Abreu, the Dufaux family met Allan Kardec on the night of the
April 18, 1857. The Encoder would have given a small reception in his
apartment and the Dufaux were taken by Madame Planemaison, a close friend of the
professor lionês.

At the end of the meeting, Ermance received a beautiful message from St. Louis,
that from there it would become a kind of spiritual supervisor of the work of the
Master. According to the former king, Ermance, like Kardec, was a druid
Reincarnated. The bonds between the two narrowed and she became the main medium
of Prof. Rivail's domestic meetings.

At the end of 1857, Kardec had the idea to publish a spiritist periodical and wanted to
to hear the opinion of spiritual guides. Ermance was the chosen medium and, through
of her, a Spirit gave several great guidance to the Master of Lion. The organ won
the name of "Spiritist Magazine" and was released in January of the following year.

\fAs Allan Kardec's apartment got small for the large number of
attending their meeting, some of the participants decided to rent a place
Greater.

For this, however, they needed legal authorization. Mr. Dufaux
took care of obtaining the approval of the authorities, achieving in fifteen days what,
normally, it would take three months. The release, the Encoder and its
disciples founded the Parisian Society of Spiritist Studies in April 1858.
Ermance was one of the founding partners.

During 1858, Ermance received two more psychic autobiographies.
This time, the authors were the French kings Louis XI and Charles VIII. The Encoder
praised Ms. Dufaux's work (2) and transcribed excerpts from "Confessions of Louis
XI" in Spiritist Magazine(3). That same year, Kardec released three messages
psychographed by the sensitive young woman (4). We have no news about the possible
publication of charles VIII's memoirs.

Canuto Abreu revealed that Rivail used her as a medium in the review of the 2nd
edition of The Book of Spirits. In 1859, Ermance is no longer cited as a member of the
on the pages of the Kardetian mensário. That leads us to believe that she would have left
society. Another indication of this assumption is that São Luís began to communicate
through other sensitives (Mr. Rose, Mr. Collin, Mrs. Costel and Ms. Huet). There is,
also, records of the continuity of their work in other groups.

What would have happened to Ermance? I would have married and left the militancy,
like Ruth Japhet and the Baudin girls? Would you have been misunderstood by Kardec? Have
changed from France? Would you have discouraged spiritism? These are questions that only she
could answer. Anyway, the Encoder continued to publicize his work.
In 1860, he reported the reissue of "The story of Joan of Arc dictated by her
same", by the Lendoyen Bookstore in Paris.

In 1861, he sent several copies of this book, along with his works, to the
French editor Maurice Lachâtre, who was exiled in Barcelona, Spain.
The goal was the dissemination of Spiritism on Spanish soil. These volumes
were confiscated and burned in a public square by the Church
Catholic in the famous Self-in-Faith of Barcelona.

"The story of Louis IX dictated by himself, " was released by censorship and
finally published by La Verité magazine in Paris in 1864. In early 1997, the
Brazilian publisher Editions LFU translated "The story of Joan of Arc" to the
Portuguese.
