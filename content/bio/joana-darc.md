The History of Jeanne d'Arc is a psychographic work, dictated by ―Pucelle d'Orlans"
ermance dufaux, a girl who was then 14 years old and who, for her moral gifts
and mediumistic, collaborated with Allan Kardec on the preparation of the 2nd edition of ―The Book of
Spirits. 

Ermance was a medium of Espírito São Luiz who helped Master Kardec so much
in the great work of Coding.

The descriptive power of minute narration, the richness of details such as
for example, the relationship of all participants in their "judgment" — full name,
profession and titles of each of them — give us an idea of the qualities of the medium
recipient and spirit who dictated it.

Jeanne d'Arc's trajectory on French soil is known worldwide. Your
obstinate bravery, boundless devotion to the Spirits who appeared to him, and that the
led in their acts in this incarnation, their immense love for France, allied to
its simplicity, its purity, its common sense and the nobility of its character have made it the
heroine without peer since the 15th century.

In ―The History of Jeanne d'Arc" we see the struggle of two forces: that of good,
personified in the pure ideal of "Pucelle— as pure as herself — and that of evil,
represented by the false ideal of justice of its pseudo judges, I say pseudos since
his goal was not to judge, but condemn Jeanne to death, as they really did,
supported by the abandonment to which Jeanne was relegated by Charles VII — whom she had made
crown law of France — in the neglect and iniquity of the French themselves who
thus made the perfect accomplices of the representatives of his death.
On charges of ―heretic relapses," (technically perfect accusation according to some
historians) Jeanne d'Arc was burned alive on May 30, 1431, at the age of 19
of age.

At that very moment, some people were horrified and repentant
for having participated in his sacrifice; is famous the phrase pronounced by english john
Tressart, one of the secretaries of Henri VI, who left with the scaffold
lamenting, and in tears he exclaimed, "We are all lost, we have burned a
another phrase that also eternalized was that of Jean Alepée, canon of the cathedral, and
which was totally contrary to Jeanne: "I wish my soul was where I believe
that's this woman's.

Only later did the French people rehabilitate themselves from their procedure to
Jeanne. Charles VII, on February 15, 1450, wrote a letter to Guillaume
Bouillé, dean of the Noyon Chair, ordering investigations to be initiated in the
process by which his enemies, due to the ―immense hatred they nurtured by Jeanne,
they killed her wickedly and unjustly, with refinements of cruelty.

After numerous -démarches in June 1456, the Great Inquisitor of Bréhal
made a review in the case and on July 7, in Rouen Cathedral, Jean Jouvene of
Ursins delivered his official verdict, saying among other statements: ―...
decree and declare that judgment and sentence as contaminated by fraud,
slander, wickedness, contradictions and manifest errors in fact and of Law and together with
abjuration, execution and all its consequences, such as null, worthless and without
Effect. ... We proclaim that Jeanne did not take any stain of infamy and that she
is totally clean of this..."

Jeanne was beatified in 1909, by administrations initiated in 1890 by Pope Leo XIII,
and canonized in 1920.

Jeanne's sacrifice, however, was not in vain, she managed to awaken the feeling
patriotic people and thus foster France's success in the 100-Year War.
