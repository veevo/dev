What you do speaks so loud, I can't hear what you say.

The thought of the American philosopher and writer, Ralph Waldo Emerson, needs
our attention.

Actions speak much more of ourselves than our words.

Our words articulate for convenience, conventions and can be very
well disguised by our will, that is, they will not always count the
Truth.

Actions show what is in our soul, our nature, our values.

It's very easy to say. Harder to act.

Francis of Assisi, missionary who rescued the essence of Christ's message
on earth, in one of his preaching, he said:

The peace proclaimed by you with words must dwell more abundantly in
your hearts.

This means that we need to experience something so that our words and
opinions have weight. It's called moral authority.

It is valid in the education of children, for example.

They need to identify, in the parents, the same behavior that are
demanding them.

If they do not find this reference, they will hardly follow any recommendation
Educational.

The children may even obey, but out of fear, by ascendancy of strength, in that
Moment.

This kind of ancestry, however, does not last. As soon as they get rid of their parents or
greater independence, will repeat the same attitudes of the
yesterday wrong.

In short, they didn't learn. They simply met a recommendation, for
certain time.

That's why we heard about the strength of the example.

Children copy parents in many ways. They mimic their actions, their way of
deal with it or that in life. Your advice will only be heard if you notice
the strength of moral authority basing the lines.

Someone's wisdom is not measured by how much they know, knows, but by the
quality of their actions.

We see thus, in the world, great voices, of impeccable rhetoric, but whose actions,
in everyday life, do not match your sharp verb.

They rise in the stands of the world, singing equality, justice, the defense of
population, when in your heart there is only the search for the satisfaction of their
vanity and selfishness, taking advantage of everything and everyone.

And many consciences today are so sick, so obnubiladas, that neither
they don't even feel some kind of remorse, guilt or responsibility.

They will awaken later, possibly with pain, with the force of the law of cause and
effect by putting everything back on the rails of the derailed soul.

So let's take care of our words and take care of our actions.

What we do speaks a lot louder than what we say.

Let us remember the philosopher's thought:

What you do speaks so loud, I can't hear what you say.
