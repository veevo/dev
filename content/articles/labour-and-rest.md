Many parents face difficulties each morning when they need to awaken their children to move on to their obligations.

When small, there are those who hide their heads under the covers or pillow, as if this could release them from what they should do.

They saw it one way, they saw it the other and asked for another five minutes. Or just one more minute.

When they larger complain about having to get up early, especially on cold, wintery days. And among grumbling, they say that what they want most in life is to get rich, too rich, so they don't have to study anymore, work.

Anyway, you can stay in bed in the morning as much as you want, and have nothing to worry about. They also don't have to face the cold and rain on winter days.

In fact, it's not just children or young people who think so.

Some of us adults often wish to win the lottery, or who knows, an inheritance that frees us from uncomfortable hours of work.

Not to mention the ones we keep counting, year by year, the time left for retirement...

*   *   *

Important terms in mind that life is not an eternal vacation.

Earth is the great school of the Spirit, where with work and discipline we assist in the progress of the planet and we have progressed ourselves.

We are subject ed to physical laws governing the world: law of magnetism, law of attraction, electricity law, law of gravity...

We are also subjected to moral laws, which govern the world of soul, consciousness, ethics.

It is in this great world of moral laws that we will find a very important law.

It is the law of labor, which establishes that every useful occupation is work. It drives us to evolve, to grow.

Working, therefore, should not be a problem for us. It's important to be active.

It is true that rest is part of the divine laws, being necessary for the body and for the mind.

However, too much, it becomes idleness, laziness, preventing us from learning and evolving.

Long without intellectual and physical activities violent the character of man, weaken his muscles and nerves, which were destined for movement and action.

The work provides us with an exchange of experiences, knowledge, learning that the soul stores, within itself, during the various lives on Earth.

Whatever we know, we will always have something to teach and a lot to learn.

When we offer our work skills, society returns us in the form of salary.

Salary that we revert in the cost of our needs and even small pleasures.

The heavenly messengers, in their orientations to the Codificator of the Spiritist Doctrine, Allan Kardec, prescribed that the limit of work is the limit of our forces.

Thus, respecting our limits, we establish alternate periods of activities and rest, avoiding excessive wear or stress.

Wisdom is exactly in reaching the balance that allows us excellent production, at the time that we also allow ourselves to rest, leisure, relaxation.

Let's think about it!
