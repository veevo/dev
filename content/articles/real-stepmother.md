Almost always, when talking about stepmother, the connotation is pejorative. It is associated with
the word the evil, evil person.

However, madrasts are sometimes angels that God sends to plenise of
love the lives of orphans.

When Empress Dona Amelia had to accompany her husband to Portugal,
here leaving the boy Peter, at the age of six, wrote a letter of
farewell, leaving recorded his deepest affection.

It shows the love he had for his son he had not generated:

My son of the heart and my Emperor.

Goodbye, dear boy, delights of my soul, joy of my eyes, son who
my heart had adopted! Goodbye forever!

How beautiful you are in this rest of yours! My tearful eyes couldn't steal
to behold you.

You're the most touching spectacle earth can offer! How greatness and
how much weakness humanity contains, represented by you, idolized child:
a crown, a throne and a cradle.

Oh, dear boy, if I were your real mother, if my womb had you
conceived, no force would rip you out of my arms!

Prostrate at the feet of those who abandoned my husband, I would tell them between
Tears:

"I am no longer Empress, but the mother very good... Allow us to keep an eye on our
treasure, this child, who is my son and your Emperor.

You want him safe and well treated, and who would keep him and care with
more devotion but me, your mother? If I can't stay as a mother, I'm going to be
as his servant or slave to serve and cherish him.

But you, angel of innocence and beauty, belong to me but for the love that
I dedicated it to your augustfather. I'm just your stepmother, although I want you as if
you were the blood of my blood.

A sacred duty forces me to accompany the former Emperor in his exile, through
of the seas, in strange lands...

Goodbye, for, forever!"

Brazilian mothers, you who are meigas and affectionate towards your little children,
I assumed my times: adopt the crowned orphan. Give him all a place in the
your family and in your heart.

If wickedness and betrayal prepare you, teach, with a tender voice, the
words of mercy that comfort misfortune; the words of patriotism
who exalt generous souls, and from time to time whisper to their ears the
name of his mother of adoption.

Brazilian mothers, I entrust you with this precious pledge of happiness of
your country, your people. I'll deliver it. Now I feel my tears
run with less bitterness.

Sleep, dear child, while we, your father and your foster mother, leave
into exile, with no hope that we will never see you again... but in dreams.

Brazilian! I'll contell you that you didn't wake him up before I leave. Your
mouth, wet by my weeping, laughs like the pink bud with the
morning dew.

He laughs, and his father and mother abandon him forever...

Goodbye, orphan-Emperor, victim of your greatness before you know how to know her.

Goodbye... Take a kiss... Still another... One more last.

Goodbye forever. Amelia.

                                    *  *  *

May one, in good conscience, affirm that this woman's love was not
real mother?
