In general, the expression servant of God refers us to religious, closed
in temples, wrapped in prayers and acts of charity.

However, the greatness of the Father is not limited. Consequently, neither the field that
offers His children for the sowing of good.

Therefore, His servers multiply across the Earth and present themselves in numerous
and extraordinary facets.

Samuel Broder is an example. Arrived in America with a handful of Poles
survivors of the Hitler holocaust. He had grown on the streets of a suburb of
Detroit.

I soon found that scientific careers were those in which one could
win in life without money and without social status.

Getting the best grades in science, he won a scholarship to the University
de Michigan.

According to his own words, he entered another planet.

For a boy out of a labor ghetto, whose grandest dream should be
metallurgical employment at Ford or Chrysler, was surprised to divide the
room with a colleague who studied night and day to become a composer.

In a few months, the imagination of that young immigrant thirsty to know, if
inflation and he would define his true vocation: science.

Inspired by the Prayer of man of science, conceived by a great writer
american, he had recorded in his heart and in his memory every word:

O God, give me a cloudless vision and get rid of the rush.

Give me the courage to oppose all vanity and to pursue, as i can and even the
end, each of my tasks.

Give me the will not never accept rest or homage before having
i could verify that my results correspond to my calculations.

Or to be able to find out and fix my mistakes.

With this provision, when entering the laboratory that opened one of its
teachers, had the inspiration for their professional life: cancer.

Whole days and nights he closed in the lab to learn how to manufacture
antibodies intended to fight cancer cells.

Their efforts were not always productive. I recognised, however, that even your
failures were not useless.

The difference, he said, between a great sage and a mediocre researcher is in the
fact that one knows how to ask the right questions, the other does not.

One is capable of using cutting-edge technologies, the other, no.

That way, he had put himself at the forefront of the fight against cancer.

With the outbreak of AIDS, he made a big decision: to face the virus
suspected of being its causative, researching a drug capable of blocking the
your action.

It was a dangerous initiative because no one could assess the risks it could
cause the manipulation, in the laboratory, of important virus concentrates
Live.

Of his five collaborators, two immediately left the lab.

At the time, spring-summer 1983, Samuel Broder's team was the only one who
agreed to work in the research, despite the risks.

For Dr. Samuel, with his forty years, father of two girls, there was still the
risk of taking this virus home and contaminating them.

But he accepted all the risks in the name of love.

Samuel Broder, like so many other devoted researchers, is a server of
God, materializing His mercy among his brethren on earth.

Let us learn to recognize them and thank God for their existences.
