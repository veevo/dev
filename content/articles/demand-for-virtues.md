Do you believe that having virtues is important for a good relationship?

And do you often look for virtues in the people you live with?

Maybe you believe that having virtues is important and even looking for them in people
of their relationship, but wonders whether these qualities are not scarce in some
Individuals.

Well, if you're with this problem, maybe we can think together about
how to try to resolve this impasse.

There was a time when you became interested in something, and you went on to notice
this something more often?

For example: if you decide to buy such a brand ed vehicle and such a model,
begins to notice many of these vehicles circulating through the streets, which does not
it happened before, didn't it?

Well, that's the result of interest, of the attention you pay on the object that
Attorney.

Something similar can also happen with defects, vices,
qualities, values, virtues of individuals.

If you look at a person looking for defects, you will surely realize only
defects, because this is the focus of your attention.

This does not always mean that the person has the defects that you notice, but
your lenses are adjusted to see defects.

On the contrary, when you adjust your gaze to detect virtues you will notice,
undoubtedly many of them.

Try doing this with someone in your relationship circle in whom you
never realized any virtue. Start watching with eyes to see and you will find
Virtues.

This will make your concept about this person change for the better.

This is a good exercise for those who want to make their relationship life more
Harmonic.

There is no person in the world who does not have at least one virtue, a
Quality. Just look.

And when we come to see qualities in the people who live with us, the
relationship becomes more enjoyable.

To help in this search for good qualities, let's name a few of them:
patience, punctuality, goodwill, joy, optimism, responsibility,
organization, respect, team spirit, discretion, loyalty, honesty,
sense of justice, disposition, sincerity, tolerance.

Sometimes we imply with a person just because they think differently from us and
that's why we labeled her and excluded her from our circle of friendships.

Other times, the mere fact that we don't sympathize with someone is enough to
ward off and avoid approximations.

And if living in society is a natural condition of human beings, important that
let us try to live well with other people.

Let us do this important exercise in seeking virtues.

And the merit will be greater the more difficult it is to find them and give them the
due value.

After all, virtues are like valuable jewels, you have to discover them and know
enjoy them.

How about this proposal?

Think about it, after all, you have nothing to lose. On the contrary, there is a lot of
Win.

As? Now, making your life of relationship more pleasant and contributing to your
brick of optimism in this construction called society.

*   *   *

One day, a Sage of Nazareth said, Whoever has eyes to see, see.

Think about it, adjust your lenses, and be a prospector of virtues!
