Have you thought about what opportunities in your life mean?

Contrary to what many imagine, opportunities do not always come to us from the
way we desire, but are always offered to us according to our
Needs.

The opportunity to pay off a debt, for example, is still a great
chance, which we don't always know how to enjoy.

This happened to a woman, approximately 30 years old, when she discovered that
was pregnant and that her baby's body was malformed.

She, disregarding the great opportunity God granted her, told the doctor
who tried to convince her to let the child born:

I will have an abortion anyway, for I would never let a little monster be born as
my son. If God sent him to earth, I'm going to return him to heaven.

Unaware or ignoring the merciful Law of reincarnation, that woman
denied the womb to a Spirit who begged him for an opportunity to return to the
physical body, although deformed, in search of the particular redemption that the
would accredit the best days.

Closing the doors to the Spirit, she denied herself the chance to welcome and support
an affection of yore that plummeted into the ditches of imbalance with its
participation and complicity.

Certainly, a great missed opportunity...

An excellent chance to redeem a debt contracted under divine laws,
thrown through the window of insubmission, without the slightest reflection.

If that woman had remembered only one of Jesus' teachings of
Nazareth, I wouldn't have committed such a crime. It would be enough to remember that each
will be given according to his works, and would have thanked God for the opportunity
Blessed.

Logically other opportunities will arise, even through the messenger that
more has been heard by the rebellious sheep: pain.

But not all people act so inconsequentially.

A 22-year-old young woman received the same news as the other, and
his attitude was completely different, before the obstetrician who showed him the
examinations of the fetus with poor formation.

She said, I don't even dream of thinking about abortion. I want to thank God for the trust
deposited in me, sending me such a weak son. I'm going to do all the
possible to take good care of him.

Undoubtedly, an opportunity very well understood and taken advantage of.

We have the question left:

How many opportunities for redemption have we not taken to the account of Divine punishment, and
thrown out the window?

Unfortunately, the answer to this questioning almost always comes to us late
Too.

                                   *   *   *

The deficiencies of the physical body are caused by the Spirit himself in it
Incarnate.

A smoker, for example, who has used cigarettes for many years, can harm
lungs to such an extent that, in the next reincarnation, has, from an early age,
serious problems.

Or, else, an inveteterated alcoholic may be reborn in a new body bringing
with him the old liver problems, conquered in the previous existence, and
so on.

For this reason, an existence in an ill or deficient body is an excellent
opportunity to redress in the face of the laws governing life, if well used.

And for that reason too, we have no right to deny a new chance to
Spirit in need of readjustment, practicing the abortion of your body in
Training.

In other hand, let us always remember that Jesus, the Wise of the Wise, warned that it is
preferable to enter life without some members, than fall again because
Them.
