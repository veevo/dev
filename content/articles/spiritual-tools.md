One of humanity's serious problems is the use of drugs.

From heavy drugs such as heroin, cocaine to socially accepted drugs, such as
alcohol and smoke. No less harmful.

Drugs that generate dependence and one without number of other difficulties in the body and
to the spirit.

The issue takes care of homes and it is possible that many of us do not use
none of the listed ones.

But, it is very certain that some use antidepressants, sleepaids and stimulants
to be humorous. Drugs to lose weight, to stimulate libido,
to give euphoria.

If we want to eradicate the problem of the world, we must start for us. As?
Starting.

To do this, some items can serve as tools.

First, let's make a list of our vices and put it in the mirror, so that
daily look and read.

For example, I like to take alcohol substance. Or: I like to smoke. This
week I'm going to work for my health.

Then let's start the therapeutic work. We reason:

I'm a person of conscience. I'm not going to spend it to kill myself.
Painful.

Cigarettes cause cancers in the mouth, respiratory tract and
Digestive.

Alcohol produces degeneration of the digestive tract, pancreas,
lungs, liver. Hallucinating. I'm smart. I'm not going to use it.

Every week we work an addiction. One at a time.

Second, let's say - I love myself.

If I love myself, I look after myself. So I must get better every day.

Let's worry about being better. Instead of pursuing the success of the world,
we invest in success on our passions.

Third, let's avoid saying, never again. I'm never going to smoke again. I'll never take it again
Alcohol.

Let's do as recommended by the code of anonymous alcoholics: today I will not take
Alcohol. Just today.

When I come tomorrow, I'll repeat it: just today. And so every day, day by day.

Step by step, conquer the conquest.

Fourth: let's say, I deserve to be happy.

We need to improve our self-esteem. Stop considering the last of the
creatures, the one for which everything happens bad.

Problems all have them. Only the alienated don't realize they have them.

With self-esteem, we believe we deserve happiness. Challenges are being
win, because we're alive.

And finally, fifth item: I was born to love.

I was created for love, I am sustained by God's sake and was carved for the
Love.

To love, I need to live without conflict, without marks, free of any
Dependency.

Believe me, we can change the world, end the drugs, starting with us.

To change the world we need to change ourselves.

                                      ***

In the face of the cellular archipelago that constitutes the body, true happiness is,
at first, if you find yourself alive.

Soon after, it is the ineffable joy of being aware of one's own fragility.

Also from the infinite possibilities of moral fulfillment, which stems from the courage
to achieve self-illumination.

For all this, let's not leave our decision-making for tomorrow.

Let's start building the best day today today.
