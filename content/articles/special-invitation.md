In a famous passage of the Gospel, Jesus made a very special invitation.

He stated that whoever wished to go after He should renounce himself, take his
cross and followed him.

This statement is extraordinarily rich, as is the case in everything that proceeds from the
Christ.

In it, the aspect of personal renunciation is not the least interesting.

The sublimation service itself is not usually compatible with the satisfaction of
all the whims of the heart.

Those who wish to live good necessarily need to move away a little from the hustle and bustle
Mundane.

It's not about physical clearance.

After all, virtue cannot be a greenhouse flower, which does not resist the proof of
reality of life.

Such removal is, in a very specific sense, not to allow itself to be contaminated
by the current follies and passions.

The responsibility is very variable among creatures.

Those who just left spiritual childhood have less resources of
Sublimation.

It is, to some extent, understandable that you are perched by the worldly discourse.

He lacks discernment to understand what really suits him.

However, the situation is quite different from souls already touched by the
Christian message.

For these, serious is responsibility.

If they choose to live the burning of the senses, to the detriment of the values
become very important.

This is not a punitive God to charge them bills.

The problem lies in the awakened and lucid consciousness.

Knowing what it was possible to do, the creature itself sinks into the
Regret.

He has lost holy opportunities, it is with difficulty that is justified
before herself.

Therefore, the path of redemption presupposes renunciation.

Renunciation of the banalities that take time.

Renunciation of the rascalities so in vogue.

Renunciation of malevolence, pornography, undue advantages, laziness and
Leisure.

The soul and girlfriend of the Christian ideal has in itself an urgency of good.

That doesn't mean i live mad in the eagerness to do a lot.

She enjoys a special peace, made of service and righteousness.

He works because he knows the value of time.

But you understand that the result always belongs to the Lord of life.

His focus lies on being worthy, useful and kind.

To achieve this state, there are several sacrifices.

You give up having reason to make peace viable.

Give up your comfort to comfort others.

All because your heart was touched by the Lord's invitation.

She really wishes to follow him.

Therefore, it finds the strength to make the necessary resignations.

Think about it.
