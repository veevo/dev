It tells a legend that once a snake began chasing a firefly.

He fled fast, afraid of the ferocious predator. The serpent, however, did not even think
in giving up.

The insect ran away one day, she didn't give up. Two days. And she continued to
chase him.

On the third day, already without strength, the firefly stopped and told the snake:

Can I ask you three questions?

The serpent was surprised by the daring of whom she intended to devour.
However, he replied:

I don't usually set that precedent for anyone. But since I'm going to devour you
even, you can ask...

Do I belong to your food chain?

Of course i'm not. - Cleared up the ofium.

Have I ever done you any harm? - You asked the firefly.

No. - Said the snake.

Then why do you want to break up with me?

The snake breathed a sigh and clarified:

Because I can't stand to see you shine...

                                   *   *   *

At every step, on the human road, we find the shadow of envy. Very much
rarely the person admits that it is envious, although tortures himself intimately by
cause of this evil.

The envious feels burning inside every time he finds himself unable to have
what others have, to do what others do or to be like others
Are.

The most unfortunate thing is that the envious of not being able or not to wish to strive
to get where the other one came from, everything does to bring him down.

It is common, therefore, that the envious mount slander, disseminate diverse lies,
spread malquereances.

Everything as if you wish to take revenge on those whose big mistake is in not asking
satisfaction to him as to what to make of the possessions themselves or the
Will.

Envy is this disturbing force that waxes the envious.

So much so that he does not realize that he fought as others struggle, if
worked as others work, surely could conquer what is
the fruit of his envy.

                                   *   *   *

If you claim to be Christian and intend to approach the Supreme Good, abandon the
envy that only entangles human lives.

Get away from that agony that envy imposes.

Learn to comment positively on people's good deeds.

Greet with honesty those who present themselves with any virtue that you
still don't have it.

Imitate good examples and happy arrangements.

Think no one's like anyone else. Each of which has possibilities for
different achievements.

And that many and diverse are the outcomes in human ways.

Some use their hands to caress the keys and extract melodies from the keyboard.
Others use them to debelar diseases, through complicated surgeries.

Some shine in the oratory. Others use the word for comfort and
Hope.

Some write laws, others make up poems.

Some look up at the sky and discover the wonder of the ever-expanding Universe.

Others are unaware of the intimacy of the seas, discovering the richness of the
life that is constantly renewed.

There are skilled diplomats for international relations.

Also doors inside homes, valiating creatures establishing bridges of
peace, for the domestic harmony of every day.

Learn to live happily in any situation.
