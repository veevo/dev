The socratic proposal of The Know Yourself is the science of almost everyone.

Socrates awakened to the inscription graphed at the entrance to the temple of the god Apollo, and adopted it as a very important flag, with regard to human happiness.

At least in two of his famous Dialogues, written by the faithful disciple Plato, we will perceive him by working the theme more in depth and, mainly, guiding how to apply knowledge in daily living.

For those who still think that philosophizing is just theorizing and rambling in the world of ideas, it is necessary to better understand the true foundations of philosophy.

Let's look at what Plato reports in Alcibíades, showing his master's dialogue with the disciple Eutidemo:

Is it not clear to be this knowledge of yourself, a source of multitude of goods, while thousands of evils cause the sbaric view of one's own possibilities?

Let us look at the wisdom of this thought, identifying that those of us who do not know each other in depth, do not know what we are capable of, what can be done with the resources we have at our disposal.

How to grow up this way? Whether in the professional area, in the sphere of relationships and life goals we draw.

He who knows himself deeply knows what he's capable of. You know where you are, and that's why you better plot the plans, and you can get where you want to be.

Socrates continues his thinking by saying:

Those who know themselves know what is useful to them and better know what they can than they can not do.

Realizing what is in their power, they get what is necessary and live happily.

Abstaining from what goes beyond your forces do not fall into error and avoid failure.

Do we stop to think: Is this useful to me or not?

We not only refer to the field of material achievements, but in relation to everything in life.

What is the usefulness of this choice or to take this direction or to present this behaviour?

Young people, who also seek their place in society, could ask: Does this company suit me? Is that kind of influence on me salutary? Why spend my time on this or that?

After all, what will be useful to me in the face of my plans, for my moral growth, for what I wish to be and build in my own and better world?

*   *   *

It is also worth understanding the thinker's proposal, with regard to avoiding failures.

He does not speak of the natural failures of life - and necessary - but from those provoked by us, unnecessarily, by the lack of self-knowledge.

It's the frustrations, the illusions we create for ourselves, for the lack of knowing what I really can achieve right now. As far as I can go. What's my limit.

And yet, sometimes, in this eagerness to get things at all costs, we fall into error, in the pitfalls of seductive vanity, giving us harm.

Here are only a few advantages, some nuances of the ever beneficial consequences of self-knowledge.

What are your abilities, your talents? What are your personal limits? What are you doing to go further? And where are you getting at?

Let's reflect on these issues... Always.

The Spirit Joanna of Angela tells us:

The experience of self-discovery allows the creature to identify the limits and dependencies, true and false aspirations, the ego scams, and the impostures of illusion.
