Who hasn't suffered setbacks? They come up in every way.

Sometimes we prepare for an important party. We've spent time
providing everything we believe is necessary for the moment.

Then, when we go to the party, it collapses a storm. Or we occur a sudden evil,
that prevents us from attending.

Or cancel the party for reasons we can't help it.

Other times we schedule a trip, in every detail.

Everything is prepared: clothes, paraphernalia, passages, economic reserves,
Documents.

Then, setbacks arise: strike at the place of departure or us of arrival.

Or mechanical problems that do not allow boarding, weather impediments
prevent the continuation of the route.

It's common for us to get angry, aggressive, frustrated.

Or else we judge ourselves victim of the misfortunes of fate, born under a star
bad, a lucky stepmother.

That's because everything goes wrong with us. It's always like this, with me, we say.

In those moments, it's good to stop to think. There are people, elsewhere in the
world, which are prevented from carrying out their programs, in a
Definitive.

That's because a hurricane erupted, a serious accident happened, a
storm, had to undergo emergency surgery.

Let us think that we live in a world where, by planetary conditions, there are
cataclysms, earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, typhoons, gales.

If we have only suffered setbacks with them, without losing the
health, suffered the death of a loved one or left the body, we must
feel happy.

We must recognize that, in the face of great tragedies, which means our
Problem? We didn't have taken the holidays, we haven't taken the tour
as planned?

Therefore, as the Creator knows of the commitment we have and of our longing for
participate in this or that, is to reflect why he did not provide for
that everything happened as we wanted.

Let us meditate coldly and deeply into these reasons of divinity.

When setbacks arise in our path, let us not despair.

If we couldn't attend the party, if we missed a commitment, a
special event, without it being by our negligence, may
meaning it wasn't so important.

Of course we'll be frustrated at first. We reason, though.
Let us think that the Laws of the Creator reflect His perfection.

Perhaps the fact that we could not participate in the event, or that we did not reach
time somewhere, it means that God spared us from a more
Difficult.

Or else, He is offering us opportunity to train confidence and harmony
intimate before any occurrences of life, in favor of our maturing
Spiritual.

Let's think about it!

                                   *   *   *

With Jesus we learn that God is attentive to every falling leaf, with every flower that
blossoms, every gesture of nature of which we are part.

Therefore, let us learn to see in unsought setbacks, nor provoked by
us, the balancing action of divinity.

Always keep in mind that nothing is essentially important to our
spiritual progress other than our growing integration into the spirit of
Life.

So let's relax and be happy.
