In the Spiritist Movement many people are surprised by the use of the word chakra. Say
that this is esotericism and not Spiritism, or based their claims on the fact that
that Allan Kardec did not directly address the matter.

Would such postures not be an attempt to dogmatize the Doctrine
Spiritist, who is not dogmatic?

It is important to remember that in the basic works Allan Kardec worked with the
generalities of spiritist phenomena and facts. The specificities would be
to be revealed later, as he himself stated.

Does all the nuances of the functioning of the natural Divine Laws, all
would universal knowledge be contained in only five works? Common sense says
that's not.

We'll deepen our reflections. Carefully studying The Spirits' Book,
we will see that the Encoder itself referred to the matter. It is true that he does not
used the word Sanskrit chakra, but employed the expression vital center, which
it's the same thing.

Let us observe questions 146 and 146 it from The Book of Spirits:

Question 146. Does the soul have, in the body, a determined and circumscribed seat?

> "No; however, in the great geniuses, in all who think a lot, she resides more
particularly in the head, while occupying mainly the heart in those
who feel and whose actions are all objectto humanity."

a) – What should one think of the opinion of those who place the soul in a vital centre?

> "This means that the Spirit prefers to inhabit this part of your
organism, because there is the point of convergence of all sensations. The ones that
situate what they consider the centre of vitality, they confuse it with the fluid
or vital principle. It can, however, be said that the seat of the soul is
especially in the organs that serve for intellectual manifestations and
morals." (our griffins)

Let us reflect on these statements of the superior Spirits of Humanity, which
we bequeathed the Spiritist Doctrine: they are talking about the physical body or the
Perispirit?

Neurosciences have already proven that it is not the heart that feels emotions, but the
Brain. Why, then, the Benefactors stated that the soul occupies
especially the heart in those who feel a lot and whose actions have all for
object to humanity? Because they weren't referring to the physical body, but
perispirit, much more complex in its physiology than the body and, more
specifically, to the vital center of the heart, or fourth chakra, called chakra
of love, whose balanced virtue is compassion.

In the next question, this becomes very clear, when they inform that the headquarters of the
soul is found especially in the organs that serve for the manifestations
intellectual and moral. With regard to intellectual manifestations, we can
infer that it is the brain; with regard, however, to moral manifestations,
what organs in the physical body would have this function? However, these organs are not in the
physical body, but in the body perispiritual.

Allan Kardec asks whether the soul is situated in a vital center, i.e. in a chakra, and
Benefactors respond that the Spirit prefers to inhabit this part of the
your body, because there is the point of convergence of all sensations.
We can reflect that they are talking about the perispirit and their organs
vital centers or chakras, organs of moral manifestations, which
have no correspondents in the physical body, are only connected to this by means
of the nerve plexus and endocrine glands.

Of course, it was not appropriate in The Spirits Book the Encoder to address the
minutiae of the physiology of the perispirit, which is quite complex, much more than
that physical body. If to study the physical body the health sciences have
dozens of voluminous compendions, will the study of the perispirit, by its
complexity, would it fit in just a few lines of a work or even five?

We have been studying the chakras for many years, analyzing them from the moral prism, this
is, focusing on the virtues that generate the harmony of each of them. Meet them,
to be able to feel and experience them, it is fundamental to our balance
physical, psychic and spiritual.

In the Spiritist literature, studies on the functioning of the perispirit have
been broad, with or not use of the word chakra.

The widest references about the chakras appear in the works of André Luiz,
that uses the expression force centers. We can find them in the books:
Evolution in Two Worlds, Mechanisms of Mediumship, Missionaries of Light,
Workers of Eternal Life, Sex, and Destiny, and Between earth and heaven. The most complete
reference on the subject is in this last work, in which André Luiz, in the
chapters 20 and 21, refers to the guidelines that Clarêncio passes to him and the
Hilarious on the topic. See:

> Apply to our quick, as much as possible, terminology
brought from the world, so that you can securely fix our
Notes. Analyzing the physiology of the perispirit, let us classify its
centers of strength, taking advantage of the memory of the most important regions of the body
Terrestrial. We thus have by maximum expression of the vehicle that serves us
at present, the "coronary center" which, on Earth, is considered by philosophy
hindu as being the lotus of a thousand petals, for being the most significant due to
of its high radiation potential, since it is based on it the connection with the
mind, fulguring thirst of consciousness. This center first receives the
stimuli of the spirit, commanding the others, vibrating however with them in just
interdependence regime...

Manoel Philomeno de Miranda, in several of his works, psychographed by Divaldo
Franco, quote the chakras. His first work published in 1970, Behind the Scenes
of Obsession, chapter 3, already brings the term chakra: "Activated the chakras(*),
through the cleverly applied passes, the patient partially unfolded by the
physical sleep seemed to suffer a delychia... (*) Chakra is a Sanskrit word that
means wheel... — Note from the Spiritual Author."

Joanna de Ângelis, in the 1980s, bequeathes us the work Studies
Spiritists, in whose chapter 4 addresses the perispirit:

> Since immemorial times, Hindu philosophy, studying its manifestations in the
be reincarnated, related it to the chakras* or vital centers that are
in perfect command of the fundamental organs of life... (our griffins)

> *Chakra – Sanskrit word meaning wheel. Equally known in palli,
like chakka. – note from the Spiritual Author.

We see that Mentor uses the word chakras as synonymous with vital centers,
same term used by Allan Kardec in question 146a of The Book of
Spirits, studied above.

Chakras are part of the perispirit and are in accordance with the Divine Laws
Natural. They are not an esoteric invention of mystical Orientals and devoid of
common sense, like many companions, including the Spiritist ideal, think.
Studying them, then, means understanding the physiology of the perispirit and its
Manifestations.
