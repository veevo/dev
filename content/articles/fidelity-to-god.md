The faithful word has numerous meanings.

According to the dictionary, among other acepses, it can mean loyalty,
firmness, accuracy and punctuality.

In the context of loving relationships, the word fidelity is often
understood as exclusivity.

It is understood that faithful love is exclusive love.

However, this meaning is not absolute.

A very faithful love between spouses does not exclude the affection of children, in such a
level of importance.

Thus, fidelity does not always imply exclusivity, because it all depends on the
Context.

A man can be faithful to his ideas without having only one line of
reasoning in his mind.

It is possible to be faithful to a friend, but still possess countless others
Friends.

Fidelity to an ideal is not expressed by the absence of any other
goal in life.

Fidelity manifests itself first and foremost by constancy.

It implies persevere in the experience of an ideal, in the enjoyment of a love, even in
difficult times.

Fidelity is precisely the virtue that enables the permanence and fixation of
all the others.

Without fidelity to previously assumed purposes, they succeed without stopping,
to the taste of events.

The real challenge is to persevere in the pursuit of the chosen goals, in the face of the challenges of the
World.

It's easy to elect the ideal of straight life when everything smiles.

It is difficult to persist in it when one is tempted, when injustices arise and
Cruelties.

Many Christians repute that the result of their faith must be a material life
Take it easy.

They believe that God's job is to assure them comfort and facilities, in
reward of their beliefs.

However, they are looking that Christ recommended to anyone who wanted to follow him that
resign himself and take his own cross.

This does not mean the apology of misery and suffering.

But only the recognition that, in a world still corrupt, the experience of
Christian virtues is a difficult task.

It is necessary to live honestly and purely, even if it means giving up
facilities, companies and enjoyments.

Still for some time, the option of purity and compassion will be difficult and little
Understood.

However, it is urgent to recognize that everything in life has a cost.

Enjoying passions consumes money and health.

Greed and avarice take away peace.

So it is not surprising that fidelity to an ideal of transcendence
also require some sacrifice.

The difference is that the experience of Christian values provides an inaccessible peace
other life options.

It is therefore important to be faithful to God.

This fidelity is expressed in the form of constancy in the experience of the ideal of the beautiful
and good.

Do not expect facilities and privileges, but always persist, even in the face of
falls and temptations.

After all, all the material facility that is given is really doomed to
disappear into the dust.

But the spiritual dignity gained will persist forever.
