The word law expresses a rule or set of rules, created to define and regulate various situations among men.

Civil law, for example, regulates the relationship between citizens. Criminal law defines the offenses and determines how the punishments will be for each offense.

We have verified in the laws of chemistry, physics and astronomy the definition of some constant relations that exist between natural phenomena.

The moral or divine law tells man what to do or not to do.

It is a set of norms or rules, emanating from Divine Providence, which guide human acts according to natural justice.

It is the religious ethic of all peoples and nations.

Disobedience to their codes causes suffering and imbalance to the offender who will in no way escape the readjustment.

Man brings the law of God engraved in his conscience and even the grossest one feels it in the form of impulses. We are all able to distinguish good from evil.

God is the Cosmic Intelligence that rules the world with perfection.

It is not like a skilled watchmaker who has formed the world, wound it, and let it slowly wear out to the end. Rather, He is the loving Father who cares for what He created.

He has placed with us superior beings, our spiritual guides and protectors, who are always ready to advise and support us. They remain by our side in a mission of love.

Through the inspiration we receive from these spirits, God alerts us, at every moment, whether we do good or evil.

We are then constantly in the presence of Divinity.

According to the word of Christ, we are in God as He is in us.

He created us, gave us a goal, and gives us the means to reach that goal. He placed us under His rule.

The Supreme Father has used prophets and sages throughout the ages to point us to this safe course.

But it was Jesus who presented us with the perfect model to follow, teaching by example and sacrifice all the living of the statute of moral laws.

They have their foundation in love and end all men's duties to one another.

The natural laws of injustice, love, equality, and charity summarize all the others and enable man to advance in the spiritual life.

Established by the Creator Father, the inviolable moral laws are of all time and constitute a roadmap for happiness on the evolutionary path.

Think about how we have been dealing with God, using our time, caring for our physical bodies, living in society and family, using our earthly goods and facing social inequalities.

For the sake of our own moral and spiritual evolution, let us keep the flame of faith alive and in tune with the greater Spirituality so that we can faithfully follow the moral laws of life.
