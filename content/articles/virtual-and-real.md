We are living a period in which two worlds are confused: the virtual and the real.

Many people, especially young people, adolescents and children, dedicate hours of the
your day in the virtual world.

For the lack of someone who guides them or companythem in the real world,
seek to meet this lack on the Internet.

They beat long conversations... Virtual. Eyes on the eyes? No. Maybe they don't even know each other.

They exchange tight hugs, but they don't feel the human warmth.

They send flowers... Virtual. No perfume, no texture, no grace...

It is an attractive world because it offers a wide variety of options and requires
minimal effort.

In this world, they spend hours and hours without realizing that time has passed.

They sit comfortably in front of a microcomputer and travel the world...
without leaving the house.

There is no need to face traffic problems, pay for passage, nor suffer
with rain, with heat or cold.

Many enter through the doors of this fascinating virtual world in broad sunlight and
only realize that a new day has already been a day when sleep warns that the dawn
Came.

In this world where imaginary friends meet, it doesn't matter the reality
of one and the other.

They don't know each other, or know each other little, but exchange countless information,
not always true, because it doesn't matter so much.

This world lives intensely, where imagination has wings...

Where you can do what you want without anyone knowing. Connect with
various subjects and obtain imaginary pleasures.

We could even say that for some this virtual world is more fascinating than the
Reality.

But is the unmeasured use of this resource not making us insensitive,
fakes, addicts, promiscuous?

Aren't we sailing in dark, dangerous waters?

The Internet is an important step forward to make our lives easier and open new
ports of communication and integration between creatures.

However, it did not come up so that we could close the door of the real world.

It did not come up so that we avoid physical contact with our family members, our
neighbors and friends.

The virtual world, however attractive it may be, has no warmth, no perfume, no
has the vibration of nature, nor the brightness of the sun.

It's a world where everything is valid... But not everything is true.

Without personal contact one cannot perceive the support in a smile, compassion in a
look, the warmth of a handshake, nor the docility of a gesture of tenderness.

Those who isolate themselves in the virtual world end up losing sensitivity and developing the
indifference to real events.

The Internet has emerged to open up new possibilities in our lives, not to
that we isolate ourselves at home, fleeing reality to live from imagination.

Our message box may be crammed with kisses, hugs, good morning and
good evening, happy birthday and other congratulations... Virtual.

This can all be deleted with just one click or with any defect in the
Machine.

But when a hug approaches two hearts and a voice wishes a good day with
conviction, the records are engraved on the soul, where nothing, nor anyone else, can
Turn off.

For all these reasons, open the doors and windows so that the sun penetrates into
your life.

Note the neighbors... They may be in need of someone who says to them, "hello!
Have a nice day!"

Listen to the crying or laughter of your brothers. They are real and are not in the
same home as you by chance.

Don't lock yourself in your virtual world.

Feel the scent of flowers...

Listen to the bird song...

Walk in the sand and let the foam of the waves touch your feet...

Living intensely the real world, you will realize that the virtual world will have
another meaning in his life.

A more beautiful and more comprehensive meaning.

It will no longer be an end to being an excellent means of progress.

Think about it!
