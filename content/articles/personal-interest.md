Often duty conflicts with personal interest.

The creature ardently wishes to do something, but feels it should not.

Or want to escape a situation, refrain from certain conduct, when the
awareness indicates that this is not the best solution.

There is a question: why is it not possible to satisfy desire?

What is the reason for the sense of duty to contradict dreams and fantasies? There are
any logic in that?

There is a logic, which stems from a broader understanding of life.

Spirits reincarnate endless times.

Evolution is an individual achievement, through which it moves from the
ignorance for wisdom.

In their first thermal experiences, spirits are greatly guided
by instincts.

Gradually, they develop the will and gain the freedom to choose.

As a result of your ignorance, the options they make are not always happy.

Everyone brings the divine laws engraved on consciousness.

Over time, you learn about the content of these laws.

Misconceptions, evils, levity, everything is recorded in consciousness.

It only enjoys perfect harmony who has learned to respect and value life.

Inner peace is the conquest of the one who was struck with divine statutes.

This is only possible by recomposing the dilapidated treasures to the
over time.

Where war was built, work is imposed for peace.

Those who have induced others into the abyss of vices should assist them in recovery.

If yesterday the blessings of work were disregarded, lost time must be
Recovered.

On the other hand, some habits of the time of ignorance crystallize in being,
hindering evolution.

Although the process of evolving is slow, efforts are needed to
transform vicious habits and conquer virtues.

The maturing of moral sense is also imposed.

Spiritual lucidity translates into work-based conduct, study,
loyalty and compassion.

This transition from childhood to spiritual maturity is not done effortlessly.

You have to break up with the old man and his unhappy habits.

That's the purpose of earthly existence.

Before rebirth, the Spirit takes stock of his experiences. Identifies the
vices you need to overcome, the mistakes you need to repair, and projects your new
Life.

Every man brings in his heart the result of the experiences lived.

It lacks the memory of what happened, but there are intuitions and trends.

This is the reason for the contradiction between duty and fantasies, for consciousness
charges duty.

On the one hand there is the past: passions, interest, selfishness, laziness and vanity.

On the other hand, projects for the future, in the form of discipline, renunciation,
devotee to others or a cause.

Each one is free to choose his path, but the work not done today
will rise later, probably plus new charges.

Peace and fullness presuppose the duty fulfilled, the task done, the lesson
Learned.

Let's think about it.
