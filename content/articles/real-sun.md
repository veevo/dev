Once a very sensitive father realized that one of his daughters was
suffering and asked her what was going on with her.

The girl replied that she had been criticized by her friends for being a person
simple, do not like ostentation and because it has no excessive concern with the
Aesthetic.

She was feeling rejected and sad.

The father, a great educator, realizing his daughter's suffering, told him, with
affection: "Daughter, some people prefer a beautiful sun painted on a painting,
others prefer a real sun, even if it is covered by the clouds."

He then asked him, "What's the sun you prefer?"

She thought for a moment and replied, "The real sun."

And his father added, "Even if people don't believe in his sun, he's
Shining. You have light of your own.

One day, the clouds that cover it will dissipate and people will see it.
Don't be afraid of criticism from others, be afraid of losing your light."

Many young people feel hostages of other people's opinions, and suffer a lot when they are
criticized, for their most ardent desire is to be accepted by colleagues.

A fact, also very common in the lives of young people, and that not everyone can
overcome, is rejection.

Contempt, indifference, mean comments, are generators of many
displeasures in the youthful soul, when parents neglect guidance and attention
Appropriate.

The young man, still immature and insecure, in the face of a situation of great stress
can go down the path of drugs, depression, moral degeneration.

That's why parents' attention is important, on those days when clouds
hover over the youthful hearts, obscuring the inner sun.

Teach your child the art of building his own happiness, albeit all
seem to conspire against.

Show him that what his friends think of him or stop thinking, no
will intensify its inner light, nor will it diminish it.

Tell him what makes a difference is what he really feels and is.

Teach your child not to enslave himself to tormented consumerism, the neurosis of
seek physical beauty at any cost, not depending on the opinion of other
to be happy.

Teach your child that true beauty is in the soul, not in a silhouette
well defined.

Tell him that physical beauty is fleeting, like the flowers of a day, and that the
Spirit is the immortal being who survives matter and transcends time.

"Even if people don't believe in your sun, it's shining. You have
light itself.

One day, the clouds that cover it will dissipate and people will see it.
Don't be afraid of criticism from others, be afraid of losing your light."

Believe in this truth, and adjust your son's gaze so that he can also
see in itself a shining royal sun, even if sometimes it is covered up
by the clouds.

Think about it, and if you keep some kind of fear, that's losing your own
Light.
