When we hear of the last words spoken by Jesus, at the top of the
mountain, before leaving the body chubby to the cross, asking God to forgive
their aggressors, we are moved.

Only a singular man would be capable of a grand gesture like that.

Certainly, these days, Jesus continues to pray to the Father to forgive those
who don't know what they're doing.

Even today, more than twenty centuries elapsed from the drama of Calvary, enormous
groups of human souls continue to act and react in life, without knowing, for sure,
what they do and why they do it.

Those who are enriching materially, thanks to the exploitation of drugs,
of the sexlatria, of crime, in whose horror scenario children fall,
young people, men and women, do you know what they do?

Do they imagine that they should restructure and rebuild moral chaos, vices
pernicious or madness all these who nowadays submit as
true unconscious zombies?

As we think of those who glorify themselves in the world, filling their bank accounts
with money diverted from milk destined for poor childhood, the health of the people
needy, the housing of those who live to the breath, the remedy of the masses
the school of so many illiterate, of the transport of those who take time to
foot, do you realize what you do?

Do they even dream of the time to return, coin by coin, ceitil by
ceitil, in the saying of Christ, what they usurped, cynically and coldly, in the days
of their transient power?

If we consider those who, intellectually well-endowed, use the name
god and the teachings of Jesus Christ in order to submit consciences, of
exercise dominion over those who think little, managing to create terrible army
of fanatics, capable of any violence and barbarism, in the name of That
who taught and lived love, forgiveness and peace, do they know the price of their
Conduct?

Do they assume that they will need to rebuild true trust in
God and Christ in these souls who, unwarned, have lost it?

Do they consider a reunion with these people after the death of the body?

No, you don't think so, it's pretty sure. If they had the slightest perception of the severity of
their practices wouldn't do it...

As we see, the echo of the voice of the Heavenly Guide, born at the top of Gólgota, finds
before the ears of the Heavenly Father, for many, in the eagerness to conquer
definitive material victories in a transitional world, hurt, exploit,
fear, usurp, corrupt, lie, denature and smile, giving themselves by
triumphant, precisely because they don't know what they do.

Jesus thus is the great love, little loved, which, in the moment of deep pain
moral, physically slaughtered and humiliated by those whom he came to love, still
pleaded with the Father for the necessary forgiveness for all of them.

                                   *   *   *

Jesus, as he gnawes god forgiveness for His aggressors, does not ask for an acquittal
unfair, but a new chance to repair their mistakes.

If it were not, He would not have stated, at another time, that each
would receive according to his works.
