He has established the most beautiful lessons since the cradle. No one has ever been Master
so complete and exceptional.

The Solar King and Planetary Governor always had something to teach.

At birth, he chose the intimacy of a stable, devoid of comfort and
atavios.

Lesson that true royalty is of the Spirit.

As witnesses of the first moment, His father, His mother. Probably a
midwife who had come to help the pregnant woman in délivrance.

Coziness Lesson. Birth is a very special moment when being should
welcome with all affection and discretion.

But he did not forget to share the joy of His birth with those who
they were waiting for the coming. The closest ones.

Therefore, a heavenly messenger visited the shepherds in the field and announced to them the
alvissareira news, telling them where they could find the boy and how
identify it.

He also remembered those who were distant and therefore a star
shone differently, announcing that He had reached the blue planet.

The wizards, from various parts of the East, who studied the stars and consulted the
in search of a sign, followed and found him, worshipped Him.

And because a birth deserves to be celebrated, a heavenly choir was made heard in the
acoustics of simple souls, to the ears of those who had ears to hear.

A choir that proclaimed the great gift with which the Shepherd presented His flock:
Glory to God in the heights, peace on earth, goodwill towards men.

A special celebration. Lesson of the joy that one should coat all new
life that contributes to the planet.

Excellent master, did not dispense with the family, continually teaching of his
Importance.

For almost thirty years, he was in Nazareth's place. And he submitted himself to traditions,
practicing his father's profession.

The heavenly hands, which had modeled planetary forms, squeezing into
details, now took from the raw wood to turn it equally into lame
for animals, benches, tables.

Lesson of humility and service.

When he left his father's home to take over the world's roads, he elected that of
friends as His own.

In Capernaum, it was the house of fisherman Simon Pedro. When in Galilee, it was His
place of warmth, after the agenda, exhaustive, with the people.

Home. Refuge. Oasis to replenish energies. Resting place.

In Judea, it was the farm of brothers Marta, Maria and Lazarus.

Lesson of family blessings, their importance for redoing,
feeding by the fuel of love.

The Shepherd came into the middle of His flock without neglecting any detail.

Unloved love has shown concern for His mother by leaving her on Earth.
Among the agonies of crucifixion, he remembered to hand it over to the Apostle John.

New lesson. That the family extends beyond the borders of the
Inbreeding. Body family. Spiritual family.

Everything, at all times in His inner life, was plenificated with teaching. Not
could be different with the one who assailed: You call me master and lord.
And you say it well, because I am.

Jesus. Model and Guide. Master and Lord.
