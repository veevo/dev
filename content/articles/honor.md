It is said that a public prosecutor, appointed to an inner city in the south of the
Brazil, there came young and enthusiastic.

Knowledgeable of the law, lover of order and law, proposed to accomplish the best,
in that locality.

One of the first cases that came to his hands was of a man who, in full
square, in sight of several citizens, had unloaded all the bullets from his revolver
in his wife.

It was a barbaric, cruel crime witnessed by many. The young prosecutor studied
the case and, with tranquility, proposed to make the accusation of that defendant.

For him, there was no doubt. It was a barbaric crime. The man, taken from
jealousy, for he had discovered that his wife had betrayed him, had killed her coldly,
Premeditated.

There were a lot of witnesses. The fact was notorious. There was no mistake. That man
would be condemned.

However, in the course of the process, the prosecutor was taken by surprise.

The defendant's lawyer submitted his defense based on which he should not be
found guilty because, after all, he had been brutally offended in his honor.

The surprise was even greater when the jury reached the verdict of innocent.
They understood the judges of that city that the betrayed man had done nothing more than
wash your honor. And honor is washed with blood.

It was not a matter of right, of course and wrong, but of how
those people understood that everything should be solved.

And in this case, only death could wash away that citizen's honor.

                                   *   *   *

In various locations, in our country and in the world, many still believe that
honor washes with blood.

When we hear reports of similar facts, here and there, trying to justify
acts of violence, we were shocked.

It is up to us to reflect and weigh our values.

We remember that, certain ly done, Mohandas Gandhi, the pacifist leader of India, was
slap on his face.

The blow was so rude that he had fallen. He got up, cleaned the dust off his clothes and,
serene, continued his way.

A London journalist had the opportunity to ask her:

Sir, aren't you going to fight back?

Why should I? "He asked, quiet.

But, sir, he slapped his face. You hurt your honor.

Gandhi looked her deep into the eye and replied:

Young lady, my honor is not on the face.

Yes, your honor like that of all of us is not in the face. Honor is in the soul and
this no one can remove it, but ourselves.

We tarnish our honor of children of God when we allow ourselves to fight back
aggressions, descend to the level of the aggressor.

We dicut our honor when we allow ourselves to agree with the lie, with the
corruption, with the crime of any level.

Let us think about it and stay in good, on the path of duty, even if the
circumstances seem against us.

Let us remember the exhortation of the divine shepherd: Whoever perseveres to the end, this will be
Safe!

We will lose good, preserving the unparalleled honor of God's children.
