The language of the Gospels, by its emphasis on synthesis, does not lengthen in
descriptions, as we would very much like.

So that some characters are presented in a meteoric way and leave us
thinking what happened to them after the encounter with Jesus.

The case of adulterer, surprised in flagrante and conducted by the spouse and her
friends to the public square for trial is one of these episodes.

The denouement does not end with the words of Christ to the exalted mob and the
woman suffered.

We narrate the spiritual traditions that, after hearing from the Master the phrases:
No one convicted you? I don't condemn you either. Go and don't make a mistake again, she'll get
ausentou of the square, with anguished soul.

What to do now? Return home? Not at all, as long as i couldn't
waiting for the spouse's understanding, after the outcome of the facts.

Go back to the father's home? Unfeasible, marked that it was by the misunderstanding considered
unforgivable and deserving of death by stoning.

Jesus had allowed him to live. However, where to go? What to do? With the Spirit
troubled, when the veil of the night was made upon the earth, she sought the Master, in the
home that welcomed Him.

He requested a particular interview and told Him of his uncertainties.

He had made a mistake, yes, because he had let himself be entangled in the meshes of the seduction of skilled man.
What course to take, i asked, since i had nowhere else to go?

The Master, who had come to the sick, and not to the sane, who had come to
consolation, not to judge, reached out to Him and waved to Him with perspectives
New.

He advised her to seek locality where she was not known, resume her life and
press by the right path.

The night relayered stars surprised her on the road to distant places.

Years later, in the vicinity of the city of Tiro, she could be found in
humble home, serving his neighbor.

He had turned his thirst for love into a donation to the fellow. He received in his home the
abandoned, chagados and sick of the soul.

He washed them, treated them with his wounds and to dulcise their way full of
thorns, spoke to them of Jesus.

I was lost, he claimed, and Jesus recovered me, pointing out the light.

Hope beckons beyond the veil of hopelessness, for all who, fallen,
though, they yearn to rise again.

                                   *   *   *

If you are about to fall, yielding to the lower passions, moose your eyes and
seek Jesus, through the delicate threads of prayer.

If you feel on the edge of the abyss, remember that those who follow Christ fall from
still willing to resume good purposes and noble struggles, in the
sincere desire to get it right.
