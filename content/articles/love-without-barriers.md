In general, we are aware of the news, which leads us to tune in,
 often with unpleasant and even disturbing vibrations.

Detailed descriptions of acts of violence, the constant visualization of
barbaric crimes, assaults, assaults, lead us to think that the world is very
Bad.

It would be enough, however, to avoid certain news reports in order to understand
how much light there is, how well it is accomplished.

If we could put all the news we've heard on a scale,
possibly we would see that the number of people is quite expressive
dedicated to good and others.

An example of this is the couple Mike and Camille Gerardi who, in the last four
adopted eighty-eight children.

The pediatrician and nurse met in a thousand nine hundred and seventy-three, in the
Miami Children's Hospital, Florida.

All these years, they've seen many parents leave their children in the hospital.
who were born with diseases or some kind of disability.

Concerned about their fate, they decided to adopt them.

Camille says that when Mike proposed to her, she told her she dreamed
have a children's home. Immediately, he stated: I want to follow his dream
.

The first adoption took place in 1,900 and eighty-six.

Since then, they have welcomed children diagnosed with Down and
Zellweger, with cranial malformation, autism, motor deficiencies, injuries and
other disturbances.

Several of these children were deceived, but many survived.

Mike incarnated at age seventy-three, victimized by aggressive cancer.

However, Camille remains firm and strong in the task she took on.

Twenty children are still living in his georgia home.

Adults work and constituted their families.

She feels fulfilled.

                                   *   *   *

Maybe at some point, we thought about adopting a child.
However, we let ourselves be overcome by doubts and uncertainties, fears and prejudices.

And with that, we do not allow ourselves a deeper exercise of love.

Adoption is a special motherhood: we do not generate the body but we welcome in our
family and offer love to a son of other people's flesh.

A son whose parents, for one reason or another, did not want or could not
responsibility for its creation and education.

It could be a close or distant relative. Or have no trace of
parentesco.

Anyway, we know nothing happens randomly in our lives.

The child who comes to us, asking for shelter, can be someone with whom, from some
in the recent or remote past, we bind ourselves.

Or simply, someone who, like us, needs support and God, in His
goodness, directs him to our arms, offering us the opportunity to
exercise donation and warmth.

This is because God's love, on the face of the earth, is expressed through hearts
of His children. And whoever loves, exercising good, gathers blessings to
Himself.

In short, good is good for those who practice it.
