It is true that sometimes we get angry with the one who comes knocking on our door
at home, in the most inconvenient hours, asking us for things.

We happen to bother with someone who approaches us on the street, asking for a
exchanged, something to eat, some coins.

Sometimes we are intolerant of the one who insists on requesting something in the
sign, on the sidewalk, crossing our way in times of greatest haste.

It is common to judge the one who asks, which extends the hand waiting for coins, which
makes alms the source of survival.

We do quick analysis, use conclusions that become platitudes, and
we label these creatures.

Rarely have we reflected on what would have led that or that person to that
begging situation.

We can't find time for other analyses and possibilities to better evaluate
the situation.

We rarely put ourselves in his place, in an exercise of empathy and understanding.

Some there are because they let themselves be carried away in the roll of vices, losing
family, employment, social relations.

Others saw unemployment disrupt their lives, throwing them on the fringes of the
society, without resources to maintain and maintain its own.

Others bring difficult life stories, from complex families, without having had
access to school benches, preventing many opportunities from arising from them
on the way.

Anyway, they're there, experiencing their pains.

In general, we think that the one who wants, who has willpower, who
strives, manages to overcome any and all adversity.

Yes, it may be true. But not always. It's true for those with resistance
with intellectual structure, with a more forged and solid character.

However, there are many frail, who succumb to their own groups, without
to rise.

We have already thought, at some point, whether we would be strong, brave, courageous, if
setbacks similar to reach us?

If we had been born in a unstructured home, if we had come across
hunger, misery, if we had no positive reference,
Would we get everything out?

Perhaps if, in our reflections, we walk this way, it will help us to have
a little empathy.

And thus by proceeding, putting ourselves in the place of those who beg, we can
replace, for a moment that is, our judgment hasty for a little
Compassion.

It would be so salutary if we could offer, to those who go through so many
difficulties, a look of compassion.

I would certainly do them good that we looked them in the back of their eyes, like brothers,
that truly they are.

A smile, a look of understanding, a nod or a greeting, can change the
your day.

Let's do this exercise.

We emptied our hearts somewhat from the cold judgments we collect,
to propose to another analysis.

We can do this one day, some day, at least for one person. It will be the beginning of
of a good exercise, which could develop, in our intimacy, in the
sequence of weeks.

And it will certainly do very well to those who lost their self-esteem a long time ago
be looked at as a human being, someone creditor of a greeting, of a nod, a
Smile.

Let's think about it.
