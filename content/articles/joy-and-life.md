Earthly humanity goes through difficult, complicated times, never imagined by the generations present.

Many wonder where the joy of living is, in the face of the sad reality we face.

The more man has progressed scientifically and technologically, his joy seems distant or impossible.

The achievements made by the human being, in recent decades, in micro and macrocosm, make a feeling of power feed him the ego.

Realizing that you can penetrate, unravel and manipulate the microscopic world, is a cause for great pride.

Look at the stars, and feel knowledgeable of the means of reaching some, approaching others, analyzing them through their powerful stereos, makes it vain.

These findings provide the creature to begin to feel somewhat creative, because it has no other vision of the reality of life.

And despite all these achievements, you do not feel true joy.

*   *   *

When man understands himself as the son of God, heir to this Supreme Intelligence of the Universe and Causa First of all that exists, he will change his way of being.

When you conceive that you are an immortal Spirit, that you know nothing, in the face of much to learn, you will leave aside your foolish pride.

When you accept yourself as someone who needs a lot of achievement, in the direction of good, it will diminish the vanity that affects you.

*   *   *

Necessary if we make a dive in reality: as long as we live only in search of achievements in the material area, we will be walking only the horizontal line of life.

As we seek growth, also in the vertical line, improving us in the conquest of virtues, ethics, moral feeling, joy will visit us.

One might argue how we can speak of joy, amid so much suffering on the planet.

So let's think: as we are willing to live life with joy, we need to look at situations with other glasses. For example, suffering is wrong, however, it is not an evil, because it offers valuable resources for the acquisition of the permanent good.

Therefore, having joy does not prevent the approximation of suffering, because it is part of our process of evolution.

By understanding this fact, we do not abandon joy, even because we can learn from pain, and evolve to God.

When love is not present in feeling, joy does not flourish, because it remains shaded by doubts and suspicions.

People say they want joy, happiness, but they can't acquire them, no longer chasing them.

Joy is not found in markets or pharmacies, but at heart, that feels and loves.

Whenever possible we express the joy of living.

If we have already found Jesus, the better reason we have for joy, because wrapped in the Light of the world, no shadow threatens.

Let us rejoice in the life we enjoy, and we always thank the glory of knowing and loving, to act with the right.

Life with joy is, in itself, a hymn of praise to God.
