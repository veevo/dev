Preparations for the big party have been arranged for months.

The samba schools prepare, throughout the year, the fantasies with which the
members will parade on the wide avenues, amid the stands
crowded with spectators.

Revelers emerge from various parts of the planet, bringing in their luggage a dream
in common: "fall on the revelry".

Respectable people, worthy citizens, famous people, allow themselves to "get out of the
serious", in these carnival days.

Anonymous workers, who walk around with financial difficulties the year
all, spend what they don't have to feel the ephemeral pleasure of enjoying days of
complete insanity.

Common evildoers take advantage of confusion to carry out nefarious crimes,
confused with the human mass that leaps frantically.

Young people and adults fall into the viscous traps of mind-blowing drugs.

That's the side of the party we can observe on this side of life. But there's another
side of this long-fought feast: the spiritual side.

They narrate the superior Spirits that the reality of carnival, observed from beyond,
it is very different and woefully sadder. Crowds of Spirits
unhappy also invade the avenues in a sad spectacle of great
Proportions. Dark evildoers bind to revelers by the threads
invisible of thought, because of the preferences they bring in the intimate world.

Harmony in the universe, like gravitation, is the law of life. You live in place and
with whom one wishes psychically. There is a vibratory exchange in all and in
All. And this harmony is given by the desires and trends cherished in the
intimacy of being and not according to the outer packaging.

And it is thanks to this law of affinity that the spirits of darkness bind themselves to
careless revellers, inducing them to depressing and grotesque attitudes of
regrettable consequences.

Unhappy spirits take advantage of the wave of madness that takes over minds,
to carry out cruel vendettas planned long ago.

Macabre plots are architected in the beyond tomb and carried out in these days
in which momo reigns sovereign over the creatures that allow themselves to fall into the revelry.

Not even children are spared the sad spectacle when these revelers
of the shadows arise to celebrate momo.

How many crimes happen these days... how many accidents, how much madness...

While our eyes perceive the brightness of reflectors and sequins in the
illuminated avenues, the vision of spirits contemplates the spiritual environment
wrapped in dense and dark clouds created by low-content vibrations.

And the consequences of this grotesque spectacle are felt for the long term.
In abortions performed a few months later, the result of frivolous involvements,
in the separates of couples who no longer support each other after the sensations
lived under the warmth of the feast, in the despair of many, after the
Mask...

For all these reasons it is worth wondering if all this is valid. If it's worth it
pay the high price required for a few days of madness.

The news will be spreading, during and after carnival, the sad
statistics of horrors, and we hope you're not part of it.

### Did you know?

Did you know that many of the fantasies of grotesque expressions are inspired
by the spirits living in lower regions of the beyond?

It is more common than thought, that men visit these places of despair and
madness during physical body sleep, through what we call dream.

While the body rests the spirit becomes semi-liberated and makes its incursions into the
world, always seeking the beings with whom it is set up by the
vibrations it emits.

Thus, it is important that we seek to tune in with the higher spheres, where
benefactors living spirits that aim to help us overcome the difficult
journey in the physical body.
