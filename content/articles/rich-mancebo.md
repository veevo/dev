He was a young boy. His house was luxurious and his belongings valuable.

He didn't lack jewelry and gold.

He had health and constant company for cheerful parties and sports competitions.

It was, however, empty his heart.

He was thirsty for peace, he felt unhappy.

Driven by curiosity, aroused by comments about the
wonderful deeds of the Nazarene Master, he was his search, finding Him to the
lakeside of Genesaré, in a late afternoon.

Seeing him, by far, it was like finding a friend, a Celeste Friend.

But where did you know Him from? - He was asked with fear, seeking to remember with
unspeakable and useless mental effort.

Unusual emotions vibrated in his being.

fruits of our selfishness and our own ignorance.

It is time to awaken to the truth, and we will definitely meet the
this Divine call.

Jesus awaits us.
