Some of us believe in God, by simple religious atavism. So in the
taught our parents. God exists and everything created.

Others believe because reason tells us that there can be not so much harmony, beauty
and syncs throughout the universe, without something or someone who presides over it all.

Professor Cressie Morrisson states that he believes in God for various reasons. A
balance in the ecosystem.

He says: We know that insects breathe through tubes. To the extent that
insects grow, the tubes do not grow, which causes them to die, for lack
air.

So it happens with the cicada. She doesn't die of singing, even because the noise
that we identify as her singing, it is about the noise it produces attire the
Paws. When she grows up, the tubes don't give her the necessary air and she dies.

If the insects grew and, with them, the tubes grew, we could have
elephant-sized ants and fleas with bodies of rhinos, making
impossible life, on the face of the earth.

And, continues the teacher, someone thought of elaborate law to keep the
balance in nature. A law that worked well in Australia a few years ago.

In that country, the winds prevented agriculture and the idea of creating
hedges, to protect the nascent sowing. Thus, they began to cultivate a
kind of cactus.

Therefore, because they had no natural enemy, they occupied an area larger than the
territory of the British Empire.

They used all possible methods and nothing ended with the cacti, which continued
proliferating, without measure. The winds carried pollen.

The entomologists gathered in the Australian capital and came to the conclusion of
who should look for an insect that fed on cacti and that was
excellent player.

The small animal was discovered in northeastern Brazil and exported, in
quantity, for Australia.

Shortly thereafter, entomologists again worried. The cacti were
Disappearing. But what about the beetles? Wouldn't they become a plague in the country?

That's when the wise law of balance came into action, establishing cacti to
beetles and beetles for cacti.

So says Cressie Morrisson, I believe in God.

David, in chapter XVIII of the Psalms sings: Heaven proclaim the glory of God and
the universe speaks of the work of His hands.

And the Hubble telescope allows us to see up to a billion stars, only in the
our galaxy. Each with its special brightness.

Our sun, a star of fifth greatness, advances through infinity, with its
planets, on an endless journey, through the universe.

Before so much greatness, one can only believe in this God, wise, intelligence
supreme, which created everything, establishing perfect laws, which ensure the harmony
and beauty of the entire universe.

                                   *   *   *

A human father, even if devoid of superior feelings, provides the
bread, sweater, medicine, help for the son, planning to
Happiness.

Heavenly Father, much wiser and generous, toasts all the treasures
imaginable to His children.

In His magnanimity, the infinite space fills with lights and, with the same greatness,
wear the simple flower from the field from the softest colors to the most vibrant tones.
