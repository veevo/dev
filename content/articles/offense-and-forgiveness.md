Offense and forgiveness

What's the first reaction we have when we feel offended?

When one reviles us, slanders or acts with bad faith towards us, what the
first feeling that takes our souls?

Most of us would say it would be revolting that feeling.

Others, we would mention the desire for revenge, the desire to reciprocate with the same
coin the evil that hit us.

And not few would we feel outraged, not hesitating to take satisfaction with
the other, using coarse words, when not even of physical aggression.

However, we rarely reflect on whether this would be the best attitude to be
Taken.

When the offense comes to us, we fill ourselves with cholera, and react immediately. Not
a moment of reflection.

Whoever offends, however, brings in itself disharmony and difficulties of
great mounts.

Slander and injury are only the fruits of those who have been lost in the desatines of
envy and jealousy.

They are creatures that have not realized that we all bring values and abilities that
can be developed. They are unbalanced in the sad way of envying the
next to what they do not believe possible to develop in themselves.

Those who act, using bad faith, with the deliberate intention of harming the
others, are carriers of serious illnesses in their hearts.

They seek non-existent shortcuts to achieve their intents, not caring and
not measuring the reflection of their actions.

They act so by ignoring that life returns in fruits all the seeds cast
in the wind.

So if the offense reaches our hearts before any reaction, let us reflect.

Let's see someone sick in the one who offends us. Someone with deep
intimate difficulties.

He strives to appear to be non-existent happiness and superiority, for
truly happy is what enjoys peace of conscience.

No one who is effectively well with himself feels the need to
harm to third parties, not at all.

Therefore, Francisco de Assisi, knowing human dramas in depth,
pray to the Heavenly Father to allow him to take forgiveness where there was offense.

The sweet singer of God, recognizing the intimate difficulties of those who offends,
wishes to return to that heart only with forgiveness.

Being offence tool is much more serious than being offended.

Effective unhappiness rises from the hands that throw stones, not those who
constitute the target.

Forgiveness for those who attack us will always be born from the gaze of understanding; Of
ability to transcend the situation, recording compassion in the face of
Attacker.

                                   *   *   *

So if the offense comes to us, let's see in it the immense invitation to exercise the
Forgiveness.

This will prevent us from carrying in soul the weight of revenge and the acid of evil
To want.

And in the face of the torments that outrage may cause us, let us remember that Jesus,
incomparable in His purity, remained serene and silent, before the most vile
insults that men were able to engender in time.
