In terms of deep psychology, the issue of the judgment of other people's faults
constitutes a serious beginning of inhumanity in relation to the one who misses.
The problem of sin belongs to those who practice it, which is, from there,
in the painful process of self-flogging, seeking, even if
unconsciously, free up the lack that weighs him as guilt in the economy of the
Consciousness.

Guilt is disturbing shadow in personality, responsible for illnesses
causing misfortunes of various order.

Insculpide in the deep panels of individuality, program, for
automatisms, the repairing processes for itself.

Every contribution of wickedness, through arbitrary judgments, generates, for
mechanisms of future distress for the accuser.

Judging by the actions he considers incorrect in his neighbor, he performs a phenomenon
projection of its shadow in the form of self-justification, which cannot
free him from the imposition of his own ills.

Tolerance, because of this, is imposed on all as personal therapy and
fraternal, understanding the difficulties of the fallen, while distending his hands
generous for the sun-erecting.

In the prosecution, in the judgment of other people's mistakes, we face hidden purposes
revenge-pleasure in verifying the weakness of other individuals, who always
deserve the mercy that we all hope to find when in circumstances
Equivalent.

Jesus has always been severe in the education of the judges of other people's conduct.
Certainly, there are courts and authorities accredited to the ministry of
moral sanitation of society, in charge of the processes involving the
delituous.

And they judge them, establishing reeducational instruments, never punitive, for
that, if they did, they would focus on identical errors, if not more serious.
Personal judgment, which ignores the causes of problems, demonstrates the
moral primitivism of man still "wolf" of his brother.

Master established the beautiful image of man having a beam
making it difficult to view, and yet he sees the cisco in the eye of his neighbor.
The proposal is rigorous, with evident clarity, which does not grant the agenda to
any flight of responsibility.

Himself, before the angry, mistaken, wicked, insane crowd, rather
to judge her, "took herself with compassion" and helped her.

Of course did not solve all the problems, nor did he address everyone, as they
desired it.

After all, compadeted, loved them, wrapping them in tenderness and teaching them
liberation techniques to acquire peace.

Thought

You have compassion on those who fall. His conscience will be your judge.
Help the one who falls. Your weakness already constitutes punishment to you.
Tolerates the offender. He is your future if you do not have the strength to
continue well.

The tolerance you use towards the unfortunate will become to the extent that
emotional compassion you will receive, when your turn comes, since no one is
Perfect.
