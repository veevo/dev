Research has been warning for some time about the increasing number of
Smokers. And the most delicate: between teenagers and young people.

Smoking involves deliberate and repeated self-exposure that leads to
inhalation of a mixture of air and smoke. Mixture containing more than 4,000
different chemical components. Of these, at least thirty are admittedly
harmful to health.

This modern form of slavery, socially accepted as a distinct custom,
reverses the scale of values. Considers toxic as the main ingredient of
Life.

Smoking tends to lead to illness and premature death. It's a special problem
health, and, for the most part, is self-aggression.

However, most smokers adhere to addiction before having legal capacity
decision. They are stimulated by imitation, easy access and tolerance
social.

They are not informed about the problems related to this habit.

Smokers have many ways of expressing the right to self-destruct, according to
your liking. We recently saw prints of a T-shirt expression: The smoke
Kills! So what? I'm not in a hurry anyway.

Cigarette smoke helps to decrease the sharpening of the brain process. Complicates
and hinders vehicle driving maneuvers. It favors the production of
traffic accidents.

Sometimes the ember is responsible for forest fires and the disappearance of
which are sources of community work.

Tobacco consumption is one of the most important causes of disease and death, in
contemporary society.

Reduces a smoker's average life by five to eight years.

Pharynx and esophageal cancer is six to ten times more frequent in smokers.

Smokers are more susceptible to respiratory infections, problems
Allergic.

Tobacco is proven toxic. Produces dependency. It does not bring benefits to
health. It is an important risk factor in human reproduction. The fetus, this
small and involuntary passive smoker, can be killed by cigarette.

The risk of fetal or neonatal death increases, to the exact extent that pregnant women
uses smoke. The high consumption of cigarettes in pregnancy has been associated with
miscarriages, premature births. Lower births.
Decrease in the quantity and quality of breast milk.

[WARNING] Connection timed out. Retrying IPv4 connection.
In the world, still persist confusing images, prefabricated by those who
wish to sell.

They are intended to defend the use of smoking as a flag of equality and
release, especially among women and adolescents.

Let's not be fooled. Smoking is actually submission, slavery and disease.

Did you know that?

... that smokers can be considered an indirect suicide bomber? Since playing away
precious hours and even days of his life, assaulting the physical machine, will come to
die ahead of schedule.

And that the children of smokers tend to have lower growth, less weight –
height, lower school performance and greater chances of having diseases
Pulmonary?

And that the children of smoking women weigh, at birth, up to four hundred and twenty
grams less than the children of nonsmokers?
