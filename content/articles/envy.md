Men are Spirits destined for angelitude.

They were created simple and ignorant and gradually develop their
potentialities and virtues.

For a long time they lived their instincts in their fullness.

Currently, they gradually leave instinctive life and guide their actions by the
Reason.

In this slow evolutionary process, some old vices lose their strength and, in
their place, new virtues flourish.

It is in dealing with the fellow men that man makes contact with his reality
Spiritual.

In this way, day-to-day clashes make it possible for humans to perceive
their weaknesses.

Aware of them, he can devote himself to his combat.

One of the moral problems quite common in today's humanity is envy.

St Thomas Aquinas defined this vice as the sadness that is made in relation to
good things from others.

The envious simply feels bad because the next one succeeds.

There's no need for anything to be missing. He only considers himself diminished with
greatness or conquest of one's.

In fact, sometimes we forgive more easily an error of our fellow
than a hit.

It's easier to help those who fall than endure their victory.

In the face of hunger and illness, they will not soon have helping hands. The benefactors, under
the material prism, always occupy a place of highlight.

Aid to the wretched can in some way provide the satisfaction of the
Vanity.

Much harder is to be happy with other people's happiness.

In the face of someone who overcomes in life, resentment often presents
and he lacks tax and accusers.

We often hear about who gets rich: He must be stealing!

At school, the student who achieves good grades is not rarely the object of evil
Observations.

He earns rude nicknames and undergoes ungenerous comments.

Comment-I know that tail, which enjoys favoritism.

Envy is always very present in our society.

The desire to point out the defects of others is indicative of this addiction in us.

This is a very frequent and revealing moral problem of great
petty.

Pay attention to our behavior and identify the presence of
envy, we firmly apply the will to free ourselves from this sad
Defect.

Let us remember that being charitable is not just to support misery.

Being happy with other people's happiness is also a form of Christian charity.

We value the achievements and virtues of others, not forgetting that we are
all companions on the immense journey of life.

Considering that the Earth's psychic climate is the result of the sum of vibrations of
all the creatures that inhabit it, we all have to gain from the happiness of the
Similar.

When someone rises, with it all humanity rises.

When someone falls, it's a detriment to the moral economy of the planet.

Let us rejoice in the victories of our brothers.

By winning, they take nothing from us.

They often give us precious examples, which we can follow.

Let us seek to be sympathetic in the difficulties of others.

But let us also sincerely participate in your joys.
