In every corner where Jesus left the sign of his passage, there was always
great movement with regard to the act of lifting and following.

André and James left the nets to accompany the Master.

The paralytics who regained their health rose again and walked.

Lazarus answered Christ's call and rose from the tomb.

Between painful pilgrimages and deep will efforts, Paul of tarsus
sought to follow Jesus, between whips and sufferings, after there was
raised, at the gates of apricot.

Many disciples of the gospel, in apostolic times, have adopted
Similar.

They woke up from the night of earthly illusions and demanded the testimonies
sanctified in work and sacrifice.

This is a collection of very clear lessons to anyone who asserts himself
Christian.

Most adopt, in almost all their jobs, the law of the least effort.
Many expect the peace offered by Christ in the comfort of cozy armchairs.
Others perform prayers through discs or CD's.

Some want to buy heavenly tranquility through generous alms.
Some Christians await miraculous and supernatural interventions to improve
his life, without any effort of his own.

However, it is important that each of which is asked whether it is effectively following the
Christ, or if he only adopts formulas of foreign worship, lacking in meaning.
Following the divine Master implies getting up and renewing himself.

There is no way to walk the path of true life without imitating the luminous
examples of Jesus.

As it is impossible to handle high flights with feet sinker to the ground, it becomes
the release of vices incompatible with the condition of faithful
disciple of Christ.

Each creature, through sincere and humble self-analysis, can identify the
that holds it to the ground and prevents it from rising.

After all, without a clear notion of the task to be undertaken, there is no way to carry it out
Happy.

For some, the front is situated in the need to tame sexuality
in disvariating.

Others destroy your body with gluttony.

Many love idleness, spending their time with a thousand hobbies that lead to nothing,
rather than working towards personal and collective progress.

Malevolence is the Achilles heel of a large contingent of people.

Likewise it occurs with greed, dishonesty, selfishness, pride and
vanity, among so many other vices that congratulate humanity.

Once the obstacles to evolution itself are identified, there is no alternative but to
daily and persistent toil to eradicate them.

Each is heir to himself and the current difficulties reflect options
misguided of the past.

Who has already set himself up to follow Christ long ago, certainly today is
full of peace and harmony.

But most of humanity, slow to assume responsibilities and
reins of the evolutionary process itself, remains unbalanced, between
complaints and childishness.

However, no one will do our job.

If we want the peace that Christ has offered, we must imitate the examples and
break, vigorously and determinedly, with the habits of the old man who
still lives in us.

The loving call of the Master echoes in our consciences for millennia,
inviting us to true life.

It is up to us to decide to lift and follow it, through deep and definitive
transformation of our being.
