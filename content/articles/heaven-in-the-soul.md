The most widespread belief among men identifies heaven as a place
determined in space.

That way they would follow the souls of the elect.

The appearance and content of this place reflect the material pleasure ideals of
different cultures existing on Earth.

Some of these cultures claim that every man will have several virgins to his
Disposal.

Others argue that paradise is filled with angels playing harps.

In eternal contemplation, souls are refined in idleness.

Such conceptions reflect the desire to satisfy numerous vices, such as gluttony,
laziness and sensuality.

However, it is not possible to conceive that sublime souls find joy in anything
or in satisfying passions.

What characterizes great men is their dignity and their tireless work
in favour of the like ones.

It's not believable that physical death degenerates them.

And that from it become unoccupied shot full of vices.

Consequently, paradise cannot be a place of idleness and enjoy.

In fact, heaven is not a delimited place.

Scientific evolution shows the impossibility of it being at the top of the
clouds, as for a certain time it was conceived.

Man gradually explores increasingly distant corners, without danger of
find him.

Bearing in mind that what survives matter is the Spirit, its rewards, and
penurys should all be immaterial.

Strictly speaking, heaven is a state of consciousness.

You don't have to disembody to be in heaven or hell.

Every man brings, in the depths of one's own being, greatness or misery
resulting from their acts.

An honorable man experiences inner fullness wherever he is.

A speedy one remains in a shimshes even in the most luxurious of the palaces.

Heaven is a state of harmony with divine laws.

Such Laws are revealed by nature and are inscribed in the consciousness of
of each being.

The similarity in the face of pain, disease and death reveals that all men
are essentially the same.

Character differences reflect the good or misuse of the previous
Incarnations.

All Spirits were created in a state of total simplicity.

And everyone will fatally become angels of love and wisdom.

Inequalities are transient and portray individual effort.

Those who spent their time well accumulated intellectual and moral treasures.

He who allowed himself to live in the levity resents the opportunities that
Wasted.

The vices and passions that door are the heritage you have prepared for yourself.

The essential equality of beings indicates a duty of solidarity.

The most advanced man needs to assist those who follow in the rear.

This is an elementary duty of humanity, not a favor.

This aid is not cinged to alms, often humiliating.

It doesn't even reflect collusion with misconceptions.

The conscious creature needs to give examples of dignity and work.

It also needs to show compassion with the likeones.

Help them understand their own misconceptions and repair them.

Who is honest, hardworking and supportive performs the task that belongs to him in the
concert of life.

Harmonizes with your conscience and lives in a state of fullness.

It is right with the past and discovers the joy it is to bring a wide range of
heaven in the heart.
