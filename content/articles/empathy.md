An elder who was about to die sought out a young man and narrated a story of
Heroism:

During the war, he helped a man escape. He gave him shelter, food and protection.

When they were already coming to a safe place, this man decided to betray him and
Hand it over to the enemy.

And how did you escape? Asked the young man.

I didn't escape. I'm the other one, I'm the one who betrayed. "Says the old man. But at the
tell this story as if it were the hero, I can understand all that he
did it for me.

                                   *   *   *

The wisdom of this tale tells us about empathy, this action of putting ourselves
in the place of the other, to try to feel what the other feels.

Empathy makes us less proud and selfish, because it makes us think no
only in our views, in how we are feeling but also in life
of the other way, in what is happening in someone's depths.

When we put ourselves in the place of the other, understanding becomes easier to
be achieved, and our hearts feel more apt to forgive.

When we put ourselves in each other's shoes, we have the opportunity to calm anger
and to avoid revenge.

When we put ourselves in the place of the other, we develop compassion, and seek
do something to alleviate the suffering of others.

When we put ourselves in the place of the other, we expand our ability to love and
to understand that we need to live as a family to achieve our growth.

When we put ourselves in the place of the other, we prepare our intimacy to
receive the seeds of humility, discovering the truth that we are all
brothers, and that we need each other to reap the good fruits of the
future happiness.

Empathy makes us more human, closer to the reality of the other, of their
difficulties and their way.

We began to analyze life through other points of view, from other angles
and thus we become wiser, more mature.

The habit of putting ourselves in someone's feeling is a great resource that
we have for our high spiritual achievements.

The heart that isolates itself, which sees only what your eyes allow and does not share
of the life of his neighbor, is parked in the tracks of time.

The time has come for major modifications, of the great revolutions in the
man's inner ness, and empathy there is, as an excellent agent of transformation
moral. 

                                    *  *  *

Do to men everything I have desired them to do to you, for this is what
consist of law and prophets.

The doctor of souls, Jesus, has always sought to show the safest ways to
our lives. In this revolutionary and simple maxim, at the same time, introduces
on earth the concept of empathy, of acting according to what we desire for us
Same.

The truths are with us. It's time to institute them in our day.
