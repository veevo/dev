Piety is the virtue that brings us closer to angels.

But how to understand it in depth and how to put it into practice?

According to the superficial knowledge that one has about it, piety, or the
compassion means suffering with someone, or something.

And since we naturally run away from suffering, piety may seem uncomfortable to us
Often.

We add this to the still reigning indifference in human hearts, as to what
one goes through with the other, and we will have the man far from piety.

However, by better understanding this virtue, we will see that it is extremely
and it does not mean that with it we will bring more pain to our day.

Sharing the suffering of the other is not approving it, nor sharing your
good or bad reasons, to suffer.

It is refusing to consider suffering, whatever, as a fact
indifferent and a living being, whatever, as a thing.

Compassion or piety is the opposite of cruelty, which rejoices in the
suffering of the other, and selfishness, who does not care about him.

It is a mental attitude based on the desire for others to get rid of their
Suffering. It is associated with a sense of commitment, responsibility for
with each other.

True compassion is based on the reasoning that every human being has the
innate desire to be happy and overcome suffering, just like us.

And just like us, he has the right to realize this aspiration
fundamental.

In the process of conquering this virtue we will find the practice of empathy,
which is the fundamental instrument for reaching piety.

Empathy is the psychological condition that allows a person to feel what
would feel if he was in the situation and circumstance experienced by another
Person.

This technique involves the ability to provisionally suspend the insistence of
from the very point of view but also face the situation from the
perspective of the other.

It is beneficial in all situations of life and, in particular, in the development of
of piety.

With such skill at hand, we can get involved by suffering
Oblivious.

And as such virtue is the daughter of love, and in his company we will always be, this
suffer together will not be unpleasant for the compadecido.

At this moment we will be operating as messengers of God, consoling afflictions
and practicing charity in one of its beautiful forms.

Let your heart be buried in the face of the spectacle of miseries and
sufferings of your fellow men.

Your tears are a balm that pours into your wounds, and when, by
kind sympathy, you are even to provide them with hope and resignation, which
unexperimental charm!

The well-felt pity is love.

Love is devout. Devotement is the olvido of oneself and this olvido, this
selflessness in favor of the wretched, is virtue par excellence, which in all
his life practiced the Divine Messiah and taught in His doctrine so holy and so
sublime.
