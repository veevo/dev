In Portuguese there are words with various meanings. Not always
we know what they really mean in the context in which they are inserted.

The word kind, for example, according to dictionaries, means: of good
lineage; noble, nobleman; elegant, garboso; that pleases the delicacy of
feelings or finesse in ways; Kind.

And the word politeness means: character or quality of what is polished; Attitude
kind; courtesy, civility.

Generally people like to be considered kind and polished, because these
terms presuppose noble attitudes.

However, the person can be kind and polished and not be ethical or morally
Correct.

A person who behaves with kindness and politeness is not necessarily
acting with kindness, equity, complacency, and gratitude.

Excess politeness and kindness can even be very inconvenient.

That's why the popular saying: It's too polite to be honest has its reason
of being.

He who is kind and polished, in excess, goes through a little true. Right
because sometimes honesty, seriousness and truth require that
displease someone.

Taken very seriously, politeness is the opposite of authenticity.

The very polished are like large children too well behaved,
prisoners of rules, deluded by customs and conveniences.

Thus, it is understood that a polished person should not be, just by this fact,
considered virtuous.

Politeness can be an external attitude, such as a thin layer of varnish,
acquired by the rules of etiquette, and have no resonance inside the soul.

A person can be kind and energetic at the same time, without it turning it
less kind.

People who never contradict anyone can't be honest or
True.

A kind person knows how to use his authenticity in moderation, common sense and
firmness, without slipping into pieguice or madness.

A vile person, on the other hand, is still bad in character because he is polished.

Generally, this misconception of interpretation confuses the analysis and is considered more
by the appearance than by essence.

That's why a gentle gentleman or a polished lady, when provoked,
may become unrecognizable, by the rudeness of their acts and gestures.

That's because the provocation does not resist the touch stone, the internal ills
break the varnish and the creature is shown as it is: a beast.

At these times uses all possible weapons to assault, without measuring whether there is
justice or not in their insane attitudes.

The thinner the varnish layer, the more easily the intimidations will arise
of opponents showing them, somehow, that they are invested in some
power, behind which they protect themselves.

When there are no logical, fair and coherent arguments, it is called for the
scream, wallet or brute force.

Jesus, the great Sage of all times, said: Ai of you, scribes and Pharisees
hypocrites, who are similar to fallen tombs, flashy on the outside but
full of rot inside. So you too, on the outside you seem fair to the
others, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.

It is this evil that will appear whenever the true character is exposed
of the individual, who is hidden behind politeness or false kindness.

For all this it is worth building a good character from the inside out, for no one
can remain on false bases for a long time.

Be essentially kind and your kindness will be externalized naturally, so
natural as the act of breathing.
