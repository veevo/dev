Vanity is a moral loophole that greatly congratulates humanity.

The struggle for highlight positions takes up a lot of time from creatures.

Even those who have no vocation for high burdens often seek them.

And he doesn't do it out of a spirit of service, but to show up.

The apparent victory in the world is highly valued, even when conquered at the expense of
peace itself.

But does that make up for it?

It won't be worth living humbly anymore, but with dignity?

Occupying prominent positions brings great responsibility.

For those who are not prepared, the moral collapse can be great.

Satisfying vanity is a great danger.

The temptation to highlight one's own greatness can cause a man to fall into the
Ridiculous.

There is little more pitiful than someone unprepared playing a
big role.

The absence of discernment can lead to seeing virtues where they do not exist. The
accept advice from those who do not deserve trust. Making decisions under false
Perspectives.

Vanity manifests itself in many forms. You are present in the will to say
always the last word.

As relevant as the other's argument is, the vain cannot give him the
due value.

Imagine that if you do, it will lessen your own brightness.

The vain has difficulty admitting when he misses, even though that is evident.

He can't understand the greatness that exists in admitting a misunderstanding. That's
more commendable to rectify the path itself than persist in error.

Vanity also makes it difficult for the process of forgiving.

The vain considers the personality itself very important.

Because of this, all the offenses addressed to him are very serious.

The damage it causes to others is always small.

After all, it considers the next invariably more insignificant than he
Own.

The creature affected by vanity gives itself a daunted importance. Imagine that
others spend hours reflecting on their deeds.

Because of this, it feels compelled to seem increasingly evident.

Like all moral vice, vanity prevents an accurate appreciation of reality.

Those who carry this defect do not realize that it only gets complicated by cultivating it. That
would be much happier to live with simplicity.

That no one cares much about their person and its alleged importance.

That, in trying to shine more and more, often falls into ridicule and becomes
laughing stock.

Analyze your character and reflect if you don't have excess vanity.

Do you easily recognize your mistakes?

Do you praise the virtues and successes of others?

When you join a cause, do you do it for optimal or to appear?

Do you admit when reason is with others?

If you recognize yourself vain, be careful with your acts.

Strive to realize your real role in the world.

Reflect that vanity is a weight to be charged over time.

Simplify your life, value others, admit your own misconceptions.

By giving up vanity, your living will become much lighter and more pleasurable.
