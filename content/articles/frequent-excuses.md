Anyone who has already developed some kind of volunteer work knows how difficult it is
to get the companions to persist in the task and not abandon it.

There are the most frequent excuses for giving up any endeave.

We could relate the five most common:

First:

I don't have time.

This is one of the most heard phrases today.

People run back and forth every day.

They divide their time between work, study, leisure and a multitude of
Activities.

However, there are things that are not worth it.

We often waste valuable minutes on activities or programs that
later, regrettable misconceptions are revealed.

So actually what we suffer is not the lack of time, but rather the difficulty
prioritizing tasks and of using reasonably and usefully the hours of which
we have it.

Second:

I can't do it.

There are people who do not know how to perform certain tasks and do not have the least
interest in learning them.

Some people say, I don't know, and I'm mad at who knows.

In other words, they don't want the responsibility to know to hide in the
ignorance and voluntary inability to carry out any activity
Different.

This is a deliberate omission, refusing to seek a noble goal.

In the Gospel view, they are people who bury their talents and who produce nothing
good.

Third:

I'm not healthy.

Minor indispositions often serve as excuses for the removal of the most
simple activities.

However, they are not serious enough to prevent the same person from no longer
seek pleasures and leisure of the most varied, on the same occasion.

That is: just not well enough to work because there is no reason
to refuse the world's futile and empty offerings.

Fourth:

I'm scared.

In this situation, the most common phrase is: Who am I to do this?

More than false modesty, the person who is often worth such an argument, in the
truth, wants to exempt itself from new attributions.

It's very comfortable to plead for fear of wrong.

Now, we can't forget that only mistakes who does.

He who accomplishes nothing is wrong only by omitting himself, for failing to
Make.

However, it is better to run the risk of wrong, producing something good, than
simply wash your hands and never err, but also do nothing.

Fifth:

Someone else is going to do that.

Many cross their arms in the certainty that the task will be carried out by
other people.

In fact, most tasks can effectively be performed without the
without the participation of those.

However, being each person, the result that is obtained in each work can be
be different.

Moreover, most of the time, the task does not need them, but they are
need this opportunity to learn and develop.

                                   *   *   *

Work in good is a blessed opportunity that should never be
delayed or abandoned, otherwise it harms the evolution of the
worker involved.

Avoid vain excuses.

Seek the work, perform and grow.
