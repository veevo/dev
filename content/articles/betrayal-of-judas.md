A listener wrote to us asking if Judas, at birth, brought the mission of
betray the Christ. He argues that if there was no traitor, Jesus would not have been
imprisoned and pleaded. Which means the prophecies wouldn't be fulfilled.

In fact, even without Judas, sooner or later, Jesus would have been arrested,
Yes. The priests of the Temple were already setting up the whole plan.

 Good to remember that we all reborn with a life program. We trace, in the world
before entering the body of flesh, the general lines of our
Reincarnation. Lines that obey our spiritual conditions and
redemption needs, i.e. payment of the faults committed.

However, no one is born predestined to do evil. If so, it would fall
law of progress and divine justice. The Progress Act because
could admit that someone could take steps back and divine justice
because if God so had, he could not then carry out the charge for the
poorly practiced.

All guidelines leading up to reincarnation, rebirth in the flesh, are
those that have to do with the growth of the Spirit and payment of their debts.

Judas, therefore, was not born with the mission of betraying Christ. His act was
his deliberation, involved by passions that he could not solve.

Invited to be one of the twelve to compose the apostolic college, did not understand the
Divine Message of the Messiah.

Judas was from the city of Karioth. Trader. That's why you used to deal with
with values, with coins. He had a head for the trade. He objected to profits. It was the
responsible for loading and managing the few coins that, in the wanderings with
Jesus, they possessed the apostles. For your most necessary expenses, needs
Basic.

Like many people in Israel, Judas understood that the Messiah had come to
the liberation of the people from Roman slavery. He was the liberator. Someone similar
to Moses, who had taken from Egypt the children of Abraham.

Intimately believed that Jesus, if placed in a position that put him in
life-threatening, it would take an attitude. The power of Jesus he knew. And I trusted you.
He trusted that Jesus would act, call the heavenly forces, and subdue the power of
Rome. It would be the signal for full release.

Jesus would be the king of Israel. He, Judas, one of his most faithful servers. Was
understanding of the world that caused Judas to get involved by such
Thoughts. The kingdom of God, of which the Messiah spoke, had not yet been
understood by him. That's why you decide to negotiate with the priests of the Temple.
Deliver your friend in exchange for thirty coins.

When he observes Jesus being judged, dragged, humiliated, doing nothing, he
Understand. Jesus would never assault anyone. His kingdom was not from this world. It was the
kingdom of the Spirit what He spoke and preached.

Freak out, try to return the coins. Undo the business. But you only find
the irony of those who, with skill, had served themselves as their ambition and the
ignorance about true values.

Since you can't get Jesus' life spared, you're ashamed.
Unfortunately, the shame was so much that it led to the tragic act of suicide.

Spiritual information is that Jesus himself helped him after death.
And Judas, like every Spirit who errs, was often reborn to pay off his
debt to the Divine Law.

Today it is a rehabilitated soul that serves in the Seara of Love of Master Jesus.

You failed, you made a mistake. You paid with tears, pain and work your mistake.

                                   *   *   *

There are records that, with the thirty coins judas returned to the Temple, it was
acquired a camp to serve as a cemetery to outsiders and pilgrims who
died in Jerusalem.

The terrain became known as a blood field.

In Judas's place, to compose the twelve, the apostles chose Matias.

                                   *   *   *

Your offender deserves your compassion, never your revenge.
