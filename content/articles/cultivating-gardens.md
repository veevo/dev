Every day, before 6 a.m., Francisco Toda finds himself in the lida
Daily.

From rastelo in hand, adopted a wasteland near his house, which he
itself transformed into a garden, in a Brazilian metropolis.

The tireless elderly, aged eighty-two, dedicates around three hours
daily of his time in order to leave the place more flourished. Zealous
also keeps the sidewalks nearby clean.

I have a motto: living, loving, being loved, being recognized and being useful, affirms the
gentle descendant of Japanese, good conversation and always well disposed.

In the garden, he planted roses, horences and dahlias, as well as a lush
adam's rib. There is also a vegetable garden with butter cabbage, green smell and
Mint.

Dedicated, the gardener built a small table and four wooden chairs,
in addition to a balance sheet for children.

I also want to make a slide, he says, who has the habit of leaving
your tools in the garden itself.

I already bought the third rastelo. The first two took it. I like to think that
whoever took them is cleaning elsewhere, reveals, laughing.

                                *      *      *

From the hands of the Divine Gardener, the seeds of life are scattered, always and without
Cease.

In creating us, casting us on the fruitful land of His work, he wanted us to
to be gardeners too.

To each of us he has granted special ground in our own intimacy. Attentive
we contemplate the horto that is in our inner landscape.

Are we taking good care of him? What are we sowing?

The lush flowers and tasty fruits that are born in our gardens and that
today we harvest the result of the good seeds that, in the past, we chose to plant.

Similarly, the weeds that emerge in them are a consequence of our
carelessness, of our bad choices.

An attentive gardener continually observes the land he grows. Harvest the good ones
fruits, inebriates with the sweet scent of flowers.

But do not forget to pluck the weeds, the bitter fruits, casting
outside the inappropriate seeds.

We have all the seeds at our disposal, of all qualities and types.

Seeds of love, forgiveness, of gratitude, of faith, of kindness.

Also seeds of anger, hatred, vanity, selfishness, pride.

The land of our hearts is fertile and receptive to the seeds we plant in it.
Planting love, we will have a colorful, living garden of a sublime peace and
Lasting.

Planting hate, pride, vanity, our inner garden will be gray landscape,
cold, disharmony.

                                   *   *   *

The Divine Gardener is infinitely fair and good.

For His righteousness, he gives us the responsibility to reap the fruits
freely we decided to sow.

For His kindness, he grants us daily the opportunity to throw away the
bad fruits, rethink our choices and renew our garden.

What seeds do we want to cast on earth? What fruits do we want to harvest?

Let's think about it and always choose the best options.
