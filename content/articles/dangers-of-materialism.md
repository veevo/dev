When we hear the word materialism, sometimes we don't know its real
meaning and its dimensions.

In general, we have a superficial view of the term, which actually represents
ancient philosophical currents with well-sedimented bases.

It is on the opposite path to idealism, spiritualism and metaphysics, provided that
affirms the priority of matter on the Spirit. Even thought would be
an inner manifestation of matter.

It is noteworthy that materialism extends to the way of living in which the enjoyment of
material things presents itself as a philosophy of life, characterized by the
great attachment to material goods.

According to this philosophy, life begins at the moment of birth and ends the
death of the body.

Spiritualist currents on the opposite side present the reality of
spirit, that is, demonstrate that we are something more than a cluster of
matter and that there is an intelligence, a soul, an imponderable being, in charge of the
body machine.

Spiritism, when it presents itself as the science that deals with nature,
origin and destiny of spirits, as well as their relations with the world
body, makes clear his spiritualist profile, duly based on
scientific methods of study.

By studying this intelligent essence that we are all, the Spiritist Doctrine opens up
a horizon of very important consequences for life.

Suppose a twenty-year-old man is sure he's going to die at
twenty-five, what will he do in those five years he has left?

Will you work for the future? I'm sure you don't. He will try to enjoy life the
as possible, considering as a mistake to force themselves to fatigue and deprivation without
Advantage.

But if he's sure to live until he was eighty, he'll act in a way
totally different, because it will understand the need to sacrifice some
moments of the current home to ensure rest in the future, during long
Years.

The same goes for the one for whom future life is a certainty.

When there is doubt as to the existence of future life the individual is
led, of course, to all sacrifice to the pleasures of the present, hence giving
excessive importance to material goods.

The greed, envy and jealousy of those who have little against what is very, are
stimulated by the importance attributed to material goods.

From greed to the desire to achieve, at any price, what the neighbor has
there is more than a step, emerging then hatreds, discussions,
processes, wars and all evils engendered by selfishness.

With doubt about the future, man, slaughtered in this life by heartbreak and
misfortune, only sees the end of his sufferings in death, and, not expecting more
nothing, you find it rational to spread them by suicide.

Let's see one of the great dangers of materialism, the lack of meaning of
existence, empty life, purposeless and without a future perspective.

We are spirits acting on matter. The matter serves us, not the
Otherwise.

Let us think about it and foundation our values on these greater certainties. Right
it will give us meaning to existence, this will point us to happiness.
