Have you ever noticed that one of man's greatest enemies is accommodation? Sister of
indifference, related to laziness, accommodation is like a disease that
few paralyzes human initiatives.

The accommodation goes against the rhythm of life. Yes, because here on Earth everything in the
invites to work. The action moves the wheel of progress and is responsible for the
human advances.

Without work, man walks away from his social group. Without acting, it becomes
practically invisible to others. And so escape so contact that can enrich
your life experience.

Have you noticed how there are people accommodated in the world? People who at first
difficulty, they just give up. Others have to even start anything
that gives folded work. They're victims of laziness.

It is obvious that this accommodation is not restricted only to work. Who is it
accommodated, takes this to all other aspects of life.

Thus, the accommodated does not seek to improve or improve. Worse: generally,
often complain that it is not valued. Forget it's not valued because it's
stopped in time.

The attitude of the accommodated is very different from the attitude of a person facing
the events of life with serenity. Let's see what the difference?

Serene is one that, in the face of an adverse situation analyzes all variables:
checks where you've missed, how you can correct and weigh the pros and cons.

In general, the really serene person is not disturbed by the difficulties,
but seeks solutions.

The room is very different. He simply says, "God wanted it that way and I didn't
I'm going against Him." And cross your arms!

Now, it is indisputable that everything that happens is because God allows. Nor do you
it is about being against the divine will. However, difficulties reach
so that we can learn how to deal with them.

That is, every difficult situation brings a lesson. But this learning is long and
has several phases.

After observing what lessons we learned from certain episodes, the
to check if we can minimize the negative effects.

The difference between a quiet person and an accommodated person is that the second
do not take advantage of the lesson in a complete way.

She stops in the middle of the road. When something seemingly bad happens, cries, if
regrets and stays for it.

Sometimes it even remains calm, but does not reflect, nor does it take any attitude
so that in the future it is no longer affected by similar situations.

In fact, the accommodated is lazy to think about what he will do from there on. To
it is easier to sweep the difficulties under the carpet of oblivion.

And this conformism paralyzes the creature, makes it apathetic, without
Initiative.

Therefore, it is worth observing our acts before life. That we are
doing with the lessons that God allows us to experience?

Are we taking the advantage to change negative habits? To modify the
way to see things?

Don't forget that every moment lived is a unique moment in our trajectory.
Every tear or smile carries with it a world of rich experiences that
we must take advantage.

Think about it!
