Just yesterday that mother played with her two daughters. But that was yesterday.
Today, the picture is quite different: a naked body, stretched on the cold table of a
Morgue. The "cause mortis" was a nicotine-caused brain tumor.

The man was an eminent lawyer. Now it's hirto, leaning back on the bed
of a hospital, with glazed eyes, fixed in space. Actually, don't look
nowhere - is dead. Cardiac failure is what the certificate will say
Death. Autopsy revealed that the lawyer's heart was normal; didn't notice
evidence of thrombosis. However, he had already been warned not to smoke,
since it was under medical supervision due to a serious anomaly
known as angina péctoris.

But the lawyer was unable to resist temptations and, from time to time
when, he lit his forbidden cigarette case.

Cases like these happen in large numbers. What if the autopsy was
mandatory in our country, we would realize that cigarettes have made more victims
of what you think.

And the problem isn't recent.

In 1971, the report of the Royal Order of Doctors of Great Britain
said: Cigarettes are currently responsible for as many deaths as the
epidemics of typhoid fever, cholera and tuberculosis, which both
have affected the past generations of this country.

We are witnessing the beginning of one of the greatest catastrophes in history
medicine. This was the opinion, in 1973, of eminent authorities of the
Ministry of Health of Denmark, country where autopsy is mandatory in all
cases.

There is no doubt that nicotine is a dangerous substance.

At the first major World Conference on Smoking and Health in September
1967, in which 34 countries took part, the general opinion was that the
presumed nicotine action could relate smoking dependence with other
forms of dependency considered to be very dangerous, such as heroin and heroin
Alcohol.

The possible explanation for the deadly power of nicotine is that it can
chemically acting in such a way that, by weakening the organs, it facilitates the invasion of
carcinogens, poisonous substances and elements
polluters of the lungs, all through cigarette smoke.

Inveterated smokers often say that this is irrelevant once
that we will all have to die one day; then the cause doesn't matter much.

But the reality is we don't die. We leave the physical body and not
we come out of life, thus being able to contemplate the sad spectacle of affections
that we left because of the addiction.

Which parent, however little responsible, will not feel burning
awareness of perceiving children in orphanhood, suffering needs of all
because of the suicide caused by smoking addiction?

                                   *   *   *

Although most smokers have no idea of this, the
substance that inhales when they give a fall, is a poisonous alkaloid, of
chemical formula C10H14N2, and which is chemically classified as a
substance so lethal to nerves that an injection of only one drop can
cause instant death.

Carbon monoxide has, in cigarette smoke, a concentration that
is at least a thousand times larger than that considered bearable in the atmosphere.

So if you smoke care about your children and other affections,
don't get them through the pain caused by voluntary and slow suicide that's the
smoking habit.
