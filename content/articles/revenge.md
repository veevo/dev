Do you consider revenge as an act of courage or cowardice?

Some people believe that revenge is a demonstration of great courage.
After all, an affront cannot be tolerated without delowering.

They think that tolerance and indulgence would be proof of weakness or
Cowardice.

However, we must see that the act of revenge is never proof of
Courage.

Generally, when we seek to fight back an offense we do so driven by fear of
aggressor or public opinion.  

It does not matter that our conscience accuses us of cowardice or indignity, which
we are interested in society not judging us that way.

The same does not occur with regard to the act of forgiving. Forgiveness, yes, requires the
offended much courage and dignity.

While revenge is an easy slope to descend, forgiveness is a slope
hard to get up.

Some people often bravely face the most serious dangers, but
they feel powerless to tolerate a small offense.

They climb boldly, high mountains, jump from parachutes defying the
heights, face ferocious animals, accept the challenges of traffic, navigate in
revolting sea with bravery, but fail to withstand a minimal blow of the
Injustice.

They give great proof of courage at some points, but do not bear the onslaught of the
ingratitude, slander, cynicism, falsehood, infidelity.

Really strong are those who manage to contain themselves in the face of an aggression.

True fortress is in souls that do not fall out when they are
Offended.

That they don't get impacient when they're bothered.

That they don't get upset when they're misunderstood.

Who don't complain when they're harmed.

True courage is one that Christ has set an example for us.

He suffered the ingratitude of those whom he had helped, faced the cynicism of the
aggressors, was outraged, maligned, spat on his face and crucified Him, and
He took a single attitude: that of forgiveness.

Several times, in His passage through the earth, the man of Nazareth had reason to
left over to fight back offenses, but always opted for the dignity to shut up.

In the face of the aggressions received, the sweet Rabbi of Galilee passed lessons
grandiose, as happened to the soldier who slap Him when he was holding hands
Tied.  

Without losing the usual serenity, Christ looked him in the eye and asked him:
If I made a mistake, point out my mistake, but if I didn't make a mistake, why do you hit me?

That's the attitude of a truly great soul.

                                   *   *   *

Think about it!

 If Jesus had stopped amid the walk of Golgotha, he dropped the unjust cross
of the torment, to turn against His aggressors and exercise upon them the
right of revenge certainly wouldn't have gone on to posterity as a model of
perfection and love.

Think about it!
