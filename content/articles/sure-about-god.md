The young man believed to be a brilliant mind. He elaborated ideas, immersed the
thought in books seeking greater knowledge. He was proud of his knowledge.

One day, he came across a philosopher who, ecstatic in the face of the odd spectacle of
nature, expressed his admiration for the Creator:

Who are you behind the cloud curtain? Why mute His voice
and screams through the phenomena of nature?

Why do you like to hide in human eyes? Let me find it.

The boy, with an air of intellectual, said to him:

You're totally wrong. God doesn't exist. He's a brain invention
human to bear the limitations of life. Science is the God of the human being.

Without disturbing himself, the philosopher replied:

If you tell me you're an atheist, who doesn't believe in God, your attitude is
Respectable. It reflects your opinion and your personal conviction. Now, say that
God does not exist is an offense to intelligence, for it reflects a statement
Irrational.

Don't act like a boy playing with science and building his pride on
the sand. Haven't you ever joined who runs this immense universe? Why
of such harmony?

Doesn't your intellectuality tell you that every effect has a cause? And that if that
effect is great, immeasurable should be the cause?

Did you ever notice the details of the leaves of a palm tree? The perfection of the egg?
The potential of a tiny seed that brings into you the gigantic tree?

Have you ever wondered who gave rise to so many plant and animal species? So much
wealth that lies within the earth and deep in the seas?

Keep sure that you can doubt that God exists. But God does not
doubt that you exist.

Many philosophers believed in God. They weren't afraid to argue and argue
about it.

After all, we know almost nothing about the box of secrets of our existence.
Millions of books are like a drop in the ocean.

We are, in fact, a big question looking for an answer. Or many
answers: Who are we? Where are we going? Why were we raised?

Science is a product of man. Use it but do not allow yourself to be infected by the
Pride.

The wisdom of the human being is not in as much as he knows. But how much he has
awareness that you don't know. The nobility of a human being lies in his capacity
to recognize their smallness.

Silenced the philosopher. The young man kept thinking. He looked at the sun that shone brightly,
felt the light breeze on his face, heard the rustling of the leaves that were lost by the
Floor.

And he kept thinking...

                                   *   *   *

God is everywhere and is inside us. When we take a fruit and
let us ecstatic with its color, its texture, its taste, we are feeling the
Divinity.

When we contemplate the clouds imitating wanderers through the sky, and we see them distill
generous tears upon the earth, we are contemplating God's care with
Your creatures.

In the green of the trees, in the red of roses, in the colors of the rainbow, God
Manifest. On blessed day, dark night.

In the face of the passing people, in the seeds that spring - in everything God is.
Let us find ourselves.
