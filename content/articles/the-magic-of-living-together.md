Nowadays, we live somewhat distant from each other. It may sound paradoxical,
but when we have so many forms of communication, in real time, we walk a lot
Apart.

Speaking of children, for example, we find that most of them use
so much the internet that you barely have time to play.

Minors say they use their cell phone even during meals or other
family moments.

Exactly in those periods when everyone could forget a little bit the
cell phones for a healthy eye-to-eye conversation.

Seeking balance in the use of technology to improve relationships
some religious institutions have gathered for joint action.

In a meeting with participants of various ages, an educator and also
storyteller addressed the theme, so intelligently, that everyone
Involved.

Then she proposed splitting into pairs so that one would speak to each other about
of himself.

That's when wonderful discoveries came up.

A mother narrated, delighted, who had just discovered true secrets of her
teenage daughter. Things she's never told you before.

In turn, the girl said she was happy to have known very interesting things
about your mother's life. And what amazed her was to find out that her mother loved it
dance, like herself.

A seven-year-old girl discovered that her cousin's favorite dish, with
who usually plays, daily, is lasagna. How come I never knew that?

Now, when she went to play at her house, she would ask her mother
provide that dish to the cousin.

Two teenagers, who knew each other by far for attending the same school,
they were surprised, when they discovered themselves there, adherents of the same religion.

And in the conversation, they realized that they had fears in common, liked the
same songs and the same genre of films.

Beautiful even went to witness a duo of a elderly lady and a
eight-year-old boy. He became very interested to learn that she had
born in the same country as his grandfather. And he asked a lot, a lot of questions.

And so were discovered and more discovered during those three hours of
Programming. It was a clear demonstration that living with the other can
book beautiful surprises.

Finally, it made it clear that if we could stay some time without consulting the cell phone
we may have a much deeper and more real connection with other people.

And this contact may reveal to us the personal riches of those who live in our
Environment.

People we're with every day, side by side, but usually
we don't talk, we don't exchange ideas, we don't reveal ourselves mutually.

There's the suggestion. How about, in this new year that is still awakening, in the
propose to some pauses in technology, turn off at certain times of the
cell phone, look sideways and say, Hi, all right with you?

It will only be the beginning of the joy of speaking looking one in the eye
of the other, shaking hands, exchanging hugs.

The magic of conviviality.
