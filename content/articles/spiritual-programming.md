Before rebirth in the flesh, each Spirit elaborates a schedule to fulfill.

Guided by loving and wise guides, he decides by certain
Experiences.

This plan is usually preceded by an incursion into the applicant's memory
reincarnation.

Except for the case of very valiated souls, remembrance is somewhat restricted in order to
not unbalance the Spirit.

It is that a very considerable part of the Spirits has made countless misconceptions
before opting for good.

Divine Mercy usually casts a veil upon the past, to allow the
soerguimento of being.

But there comes a time when he has already treasured a lot of understanding of life and
accustomed to forgive.

When the soul is concerned with loving and forgets to condemn it is that it can remember more
widely what he lived.

The compassion that naturally applies to the similar credentials to know its
history and to forgive himself as well.

While love does not dominate being, it continues to grope in its evolution.

But it always has the support of more evolved friends, who help him
plan future experiences.

Free will is usually respected and no one is obliged to live what
you don't want to.

The Spirit, at his own risk, can delay for a time the very
readjustment with cosmic laws.

However, there is no peace and well-being without a clear conscience.

Sooner or later, he decides to dignify himself before his own eyes.

The spectacle of happiness of good spirits is a tempting stimulus for those who
follows in the rear.

Between remaining unbalanced and working for one's own happiness, work
seems highly desirable.

A certain exception as to freedom in the choice of tests and atonements occurs in the
case of spirits very hardened.

If freedom integrates the Divine Law, so does progress.

All Spirits must evolve to God.

When aware, they actively participate in decisions about what they need to
Live.

It is even common for them to ask for too rude evidence, in the eagerness to progress quickly.

So spiritual friends seek to convince them to be more modest in their
Claim.

It is better to move forward more slowly than to go bankrupt in a grand project.

However, when the Spirit is renitent in evil or a lazy bruise, it can
led to an existence you do not want.

Beings who have gone mad in cruel experiences or who have lost their discernment in
rebellions against divine laws are momentarily protected in their
refazimento.

Being is as freer as more aware of your duties.

It would not occur to any parent to let the child decide whether or not to go to the
School.

Like no sensible father would force his son to attend a college that hates it.

In everything, balance and respect must be in place for those who have maturity to
Self-determination.

Thus, based on freedom, responsibility and knowledge of the past, they are
earthly stocks have been programmed.

This is not a thorough roadmap or an inexorable destination.

Some remarkable events are scheduled, but the conduct to be adopted is
responsibility of the reincarnation.

This is free to behave worthily or to rebel and escape duty
that presents itself in your life.

The relevant thing is that no one is a helpless victim of capricious forces or
Arbitrary.

In everything we have cosmic justice, which takes advantage of human mistakes and successes to
lead the Spirits to happiness.

Think about it.
