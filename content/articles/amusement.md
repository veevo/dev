Life is an exercise in discipline.

Since childhood, the creature has been conditioned to fulfill certain
Papers.

At school, there are rules to be obeyed.

There is an entry and exit time, recess interval and the authority of the
Teachers.

Later, at work, there are also standards to meet.

It is necessary to treat colleagues with education, to be kind to the clientele,
give deference to the chief.

Surrounded by so many duties and limits, man shapes his personality and
is pleasant before society.

Some remnants of barbarism arise at the time of friction and discussions.

But in data environments they need to be controlled, under penalty of severe
Consequences.

If a professional treats his client, he loses it to the competition.

Those who allow themselves to offend co-workers are at serious risk of
become unemployed.

The student who rebels against school rules and tasks is subject to repeating
several times the same year.

It is the dynamics of life that imposes better behaviour on men than
that what is natural to them.

By force of disciplinary, the creature slowly dominates its own impulses
Negative.

However, there is a space of life in which lower trends show the whole
your strength.

These are leisure moments.

In them no one forces themselves to be better or different from what it really is.

Those who control their own food, on weekdays, often behave
like a glutton over the weekend.

Others spend their days drinking and watching nonsense on television.

Some use their free time watching internet porn, attending
bars and speaking ill of the absentees.

Another singular behavior is that presented in some types of meetings of
friends or acquaintances.

Often embarrassing and dangerous pranks arise, such as playing others
rivers and pools.

In these situations, the desire of those who do not want to
Participate.

It seems even more interesting to appropriate the person who resists and forced it
to do what you don't want.

The curious thing is that the practitioners of these strange games are usually
ropes and respectful.

Only on the clearances are that aggressive and vexatious behaviors are allowed.

They abandon their usual pattern of conduct and treat the similar one without limits or
Respect.

The need for playful moments is not unknown.

Human life cannot be linked to endless duties.

It is good and useful that men be congrace, be light and pleasant.

But it's interesting to realize how free time itself is spent.

It tells more about the deep tendencies of the creature than any other
Thing.

In it are revealed the true tastes, the trends that come from the past
millennial, cultivated in countless lives.

So pay attention to your behavior in the moments off.

Don't you approach the brutes in your leisure moments?

Chance is overcome by the taste of idleness, gluttony, lust or
Brutality?

Notice how you are when you don't have to obey any rules.

If you don't find your behavior too noble, take an use to change it.

Not because others force you to do that, but because you want to be someone balanced
and worthy in every moment of his life.
