Happiness is not from this world is a well-known quote.

It corresponds to a reality, for rarely in the world all that
if you think it's necessary for someone to be perfectly happy.

Health, youth, beauty and money enter this equation.

However, even in the presence of such objective factors, the creature often
suffers from intimate torments.

You often see being apparently privileged to complain about life.

Psychologists and psychiatrists are also frequented by those who
who would have thought he was happy and sated.

But the vast majority of human beings struggle with numerous problems.

In the most varied planes of existence, dramas follow.

Financial, relationship or health difficulties call for attention.

Faced with the natural disappointments of the world, sometimes creatures rebel.

When achieved by tearing experiences, they imagine themselves abandoned by
god.

This way of feeling reveals a very narrow understanding of life.

He would even be reasonable if it all exhausted itself in a single existence
material.

Before the life that follows pujante beyond the tomb, the material problems
decrease in importance.

In the face of this broad context, difficulties are not tragedies, but simple
Challenges.

In every man resides a prospective angel.

He is toasted with the experiences necessary to achieve his august
Potential.

The pain, no greater they may be, always pass.

Even an incurable illness has its termination.

After the death of the physical body, the Spirit continues his journey.

If he managed to pass with dignity through the test, he resurfaces stronger and virtuous.

If complaints and riots have been allowed, you will have to redo the lesson.

It is appropriate to keep that in mind when facing the crises of life.

God is a loving and good Father.

He does not rejoice in torturing His creatures.

The pains of the world have transcendent purposes.

Most are provided by men themselves, with their passions and misconceptions.

They all pose challenges.

No one should cherish masochism and rejoice in suffering.

You have to fight to get out of all the difficulties and regain well-being.

But in the face of inelutable situations, when nothing can be done, it is necessary to
think of Divine Goodness.

It doesn't reveal itself just when everything seems to be under a blue sky, on the tables
abundant and radiant smiles.

The Goodness of God also manifests itself in the suffering that makes man fitter
to understand the pain of the similar.

It is present in the embarrassing situations that undermine pride, vanity
and indifference.

Life on Earth is fleeting and is intended for the fraud of being.

Living land provides the rescue of misunderstandings of the past and preparation for
sublime stages of immortal existence.

In a material and still quite inferior world, the shocks and disappointments
are inevitable.

Only a living faith in Divine Goodness allows man to preserve his heart
free of bitterness.

Think about it.
