In a well-known passage from the Gospel, Jesus guided His Apostles about the
mission they would have ahead of them.

He claimed he sent them like sheep in the middle of wolves.

Therefore, they should be meek as doves and prudent like snakes.

From this narrative, it is possible to extract very useful lessons.

Jesus exhorted His most direct aides to the work of evangelization.

But he tried to clarify them about the difficulties they would encounter.

In his condition good and idealistic men would be like sheep in the midst of
Wolves.

This significant image persists current.

There's still a lot of evil on Earth.

The dishonest, the profiteers and the remain in large numbers.

Although progress in 2,000 years persists as a difficult task
living with purity and dignity.

Hence, every day, it is worth remembering The Lesson of Jesus.

You have to move on, live and sow good.

But without being naïve and thinking the world is pink.

It is a dangerous illusion to see good where there is no or fail to identify the
evil where he is.

The Christian must be loyal and generous, but not foolish.

To ruin your task, you need to be tame as doves and prudent as
the snakes.

Meekness is precious to avoid involvement with the currents of hatred and
Intolerance.

Genuine goodness never wears out, even when misunderstood and vilified.

The idealist finds the justification of life in its ideal, not in the behavior
Oblivious.

Even if the results take a while or don't seem to come, it moves on.

However, meekness is not enough.

You also need to use prudence.

That is, be practical and know how to measure the means available to achieve the
Purposes.

Ideally, it's important to have strength in difficult times.

But it's indenocable to realize the world you live in.

Thus, the Christian is both sweet and decided.

With sweetness and energy, he carries out his task in the world.

Kind and idealistic, but also practical and lucid.

He realizes the difficulties of those around him, but he still estimates them and
Values.

By identifying the needs of those of the people of the people, without scorning anyone, it is that it can be
salt of the earth and light of the world.

In fact, in this sense, Jesus' lesson is very significant.

It is noted that the master identified virtue in a serpent.

It is an animal usually revulsion and fear and taken by
symbol of negative things.

But Christ used a characteristic of His and positively highlighted it.

In the face of difficult people, you have to act like this.

Perceive their virtues and encourage them.

Gradually, the good that is stimulated and values becomes pujante, while evil
loses his strength.

Think about it.
