When you were born on Earth, it looked like a half-dead bird that the storm
he had thrown on a forgotten beach.

Then a huge tenderness appeared in a woman's heart.

By your mother's hands you've been washed and fed thousands of times.

Simply for love.

You grew up strong.

When the veil of child naivety involved his little head, teachers
they realized their intelligence. And they fed her with the first letters and with
all the wealth that the school provides.

You've become young.

And in the vigor of his youth, the lack of concern was the tonic of his days.

It was then that friends noticed their character as nobility in gestures and directed
your journey to the blessings of work.

You've been rich in experience.

In the hardness, the disease came to pay him a long visit.

When everyone already imagined that you would leave for the big trip, doctors
diligent ly extended the effective remedy and sublime strength that existed within
you beat the disease.

Recovered, you returned to the lides.

So there were hours of misunderstanding, professional pressures, situations of
discomfort, created by envy and slander.

At these times, amid sore tears, you could hear comfort songs,
calling it to hope and joy.

He's been here. The years have doubled.

Wherever you follow, you realize the invisible light that lightens your
Thoughts.

If you suffer, it's the support that arrives.

If you make a mistake, it's the voice that corrects. If you fear or falter, before unusual
situation, it is the arm that sustains.

If you find yourself immersed in solitude, it is the company that consoles.

At all times in his life, from the first wanders to those of today, in
any circumstance, you depend on that someone.

We speak of God, Our Father, whom we must learn to love and respect, for
we find ourselves in Him as the fruit in the tree.

He sustains us and His sap desicdents us.

And even if everything seems against us, abandoned or misunderstood by the
affections, suffering the blows of rudest adversity, we will never be far away
of God's presence.

                                   *   *   *

Did you know that?

Did you know that God provides us with different moments to enrich our
Spirit?

Thus, the presence of the disease is a time for meditation on the fragility
Organic.

The manifestation of health is time to act well, valuing it.

The cove of prayer is a moment of interior enlightenment.

The time of the ordeal is a moment of liberating rescue.

Let us think about it and enjoy every moment as God's gifts.
