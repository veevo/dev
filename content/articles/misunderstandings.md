Misunderstandings

How many times do we feel misunderstood?

The answer must be: Often... – In a tone of vent or lamentation
Deep.

We still feel like victims when we go through such everyday situations.
Some of us seem to collect dissaids.

And when we have a chance, we show our frustration.

It turns out that no one can win the earth's journey without facing the
obstacles necessary for its interior lighting process.

It would be naïve or escape, we want to pass exempt from all this.

Among these so many challenges that prove to us incessantly, those of
moral nature are made the most tormentors.

They are the ones who reach our intimate resistances and conspire against harmony
Personal.

Among these, in the social relationship, the misunderstanding, creator of
regrettable situations.

Misunderstanding has roots in intimate behaviors that mask, renewing
the forms of aggression and maintaining the same acidity.

Stimulated by envy, it causes unsustainable situations.

The competition sickens encourages her, seeking to overthrow the apparent opponent.

Malice favors exchange for its sick action, spreading
suspicions and slander.

Misunderstanding lies in germ in the human soul still in the process of growth.
Inheritance of aggressive instincts, arises with insistence on minds and search
residence in hearts.

Due to the inferiority of men, misunderstanding favors the collapse of
excellent buildings of love.

Those who do not reach, those who cannot, wish to overthrow those who will
further, higher.

Those who still do not feel, who have not yet transformed, do not understand how
those further ahead they succeeded and question their victories.

Those who don't feel the way we feel can't understand our hearts.

Let us remember that the most selfless promoters of progress have suffered the
misunderstanding of their contemporaries.

Embraced to the ideal, they could not agree with the frivolous and evil ones that the
sought, in an attempt at friendship to divert them from commitment.

The Saints experienced it in the flesh, trampled and persecuted in the groups of
where they originated.

The missionaries of good found themselves sacrificed and confused, because they did not stop,
giving in to their ideals.

The envious created them with thorns and pains, enjoying seeing them almost
Succumbing...

                                   *   *   *

No one will be able to walk in peace in the crowd.

Ideological and moral, vibratory and cultural differences will not, for
while, may fraternity help and love to ampare.

So let us forgive our pursuers. They are already unhappy, because of the
that cultivate in the intimate and what they really are.

Let us continue in confidence, without having to comply to examine the misunderstandings of the
Way.

Stonings adopt the task of only assaulting.

Let's be the ones who advance, understanding.

Whatever harm they do to us, it won't hurt us. On the contrary, it will promote us to
higher education, if we know how to face the situation.

Our example of humility will be a call to renewal, peace.

Let us not stop, nor grieve in the face of misunderstandings.

Let us proceed with intimate joy through the script we elect and do not look at
Back.
