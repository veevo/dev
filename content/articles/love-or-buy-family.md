From a young age, a habit settles on us: solving problems by buying
Things. Have you noticed how fairly common this situation is?

It starts when children watch ads on TV and pressure parents to
buy them toys and sweets.

In turn, fathers and mothers are also led to believe that their children will be
happier if they have more and more material things.

It's consumerism settling in. Instead of facing this crisis by educating the
parents generally satisfy it.

It is an attitude that reinforces the belief that one can have everything and that things
materials are the reason for happiness.

Many parents even try to make up for the long hours away from home
making overshopping.

They fill their children with objects, and quickly, children learn to negotiate.
They become increasingly demanding and consumerist.

As a teenager, purchases continue: electronic devices replace
Toys. They are mobile phones, computers and video games immediately
replaced when new models appear.

Allowances become bigger and soon the children disappear from the house, in company
of friends. They live in endless people, with easy access to alcohol, smoking and
drug addiction.

The next step is to buy them a car, an apartment...

And then the question is: in these almost two decades in which they live with their parents, the
who learned? What examples did you receive?

Do you really know your parents? They are prepared to love or to
Buy?

And what about the parents? Do they really know your children? You know your
dreams and aspirations? Have you heard your frustrations and problems?

Then you reach the adult world. And unfortunate situations continue to be
resolved to the purchase basis.

Clothes and shoes, cars, wines, jewelry. Ostentation hides unhappiness.

False is this happiness based on having things. It stimulates materialism and
destroys what we have most beautiful: family coexistence, the construction of
precious memories.

Loving the family includes supporting it in their needs, providing for the study of
children, ensure food and leisure. But, very different is to replace the
presence of love for the present – however richly packed it may be.

A son is a divine gift. A responsibility that includes not only
give you material things, but give you emotional, psychological support.

You have to talk to your children, meet them, probe what you think, reflect on
what they do.

The same goes for the couple: after a few years of coexistence, the conversations,
rather so intimate, they are usually replaced by gifts, such as flowers and
Jewelry.

Gradually the complicity, partnership and even attraction are sofared.

What about the parents? They age alone, surrounded by nurses or paid people
to take care of them. Old parents, isolated, with their manias and conversations that
nobody wants to hear it.

How happy they would be with longer visits and conversations.

For all this, reflect today: am I loving or buying my family?
