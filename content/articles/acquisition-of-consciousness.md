Allan Kardec, the great responsible for the Codification of Spiritism, asked
to the wise of the space where god's laws are written.

And they answered: In conscience.

In this way, all human beings bring with them, carved into their own
consciousness, the Divine Laws.

However, although they are written, not everyone can read and interpret these
Laws and practice them. For this it is necessary the development of moral sense.

This achievement is the result of personal effort, study, meditation,
noble thoughts.

The awakening of consciousness is a natural effect of the evolutionary process, and this
achievement will allow us to evaluate profound factors such as good and evil, the
right and wrong, duty and irresponsibility, honor and dishonor, noble
and the vulgar, lawful and irregular, freedom and freedom.

This awareness is not of an intellectual nature, activity of the mechanisms
Brain. It is strength that drives them, because born in experiences
evolution, to be externalized in the form of actions.

We find it in intellectually uncultivated people, and absent in others,
with academic knowledge.

Specialists in respiratory problems, for example, who know the damage
caused by smoking, alcoholism and other drugs, and that, despite
of this, they use, themselves, any of these scourges, demonstrate that still
have not developed full consciousness.

Your cultural data is fragile in such a way that they have no value for
maintain healthy conduct.

On the other hand, there are individuals who do not have intellectual knowledge but have
lucidity to act in the face of the challenges of existence, electing a
not aggressive and worthy, even at the expense of sacrifices.

Consciousness can be trained through the exercise of moral values
which aim for the good of others and, consequently, the good itself.

If you wish to enlighten your consciousness, here are some brief rules that will help
you achieve this purpose:

Manage your conflicts. Psychological conflict is inherent in nature
human and all suffer it.

Avoid electing model men to follow. They are also fallible and sometimes
undertake, which in no way should constitute disincentive.

Allow yourself to be a higher dose of confidence in your values, striving to
improve always and without discouragement. If you miss, repeat the action, if you get it right, follow
Ahead.

Don't run away from tackling problems using false excuses,
compromising, which will surprise you later with unfortunate dependencies.

React to depression, working without self-pity or lazy accommodation.

Keep in mind that yours are not the worst problems. They weigh the volume that
You give them.

Free yourself from the pessimistic and meditate complaint more in the formulas to persevere and
Produce.

Never give way to empty hour, which fills in boredom, malaise or
Disturbance.

Remember that you are human and the awareness process is slow. You
safety and lucidity through continuous and firm action.

                                   *   *   *

Earthly existence is an opportunity for continuous enrichment.

Every moment is the opportunity of new growth-providing action,
knowledge, of conquest.

Knowing how to use it is a challenge for the creature that aspires to new achievements.

Think about it, but think about it now!
