In ancient China the princes married girls between the ages of 12 and 13. The
young wives were practically children and their ovaries were not yet
matured to raise children. For this reason, priests who practiced
acupuncture introduced a golden needle into the ear pavilion to mature
the gonads. 

The fact that the little princesses appear in public with that
prop in the ear aroused the vanity of the other women, who went on to
imitate them, and the earring turned to fashion. 

It is noteworthy that, at first, the needle was placed by priests who
knew the effects caused by that metal object on the body of the
young wives. 

Over time the use of earrings has been popularizing and today is used to
indiscriminate form and in the most varied regions of the body. However, these
objects cross certain areas of force and can cause organic disturbances of the
most varied. 

Drilling with metals can disrupt or accelerate energy flow in
regions of the body and cause serious illness. 

Sometimes the person puts on one or more earrings and passes the
feel symptoms that i didn't feel before without realizing that this is the result
use, in inadequate region, of this piercing object.  

In the name of vanity many people make use of products that have not yet been well
tested by the experts, and of whom the side effects are unknown
that may cause. This is the case with the unmeasured use of silicone, only by vanity,
that can cause damage to the health of the woman who does these implants without any
Criterion. 

There are also the chemicals of various order, which are used to combat the
carved marks on the face, by age. It is important to think about these
questions to know if it's worth being fashionable but sick.  

Be aesthetically beautiful, but offering varied health risks. Except for the
cases where there is a therapeutic need or a relevant aesthetic correction,
taking risks of this nature is, at the very least, lack of common sense.  

Moreover, if you have ever decided to put earrings, piercing or other prop any,
that's your right. 

But consider consulting an expert on the subject, a
acupuncturist who knows the point that will not bring you health risks. After all,
accounts, if you think it's important to be up to date with fashion, consider that more
important ly, is to be up to date with health, with life, at last.
