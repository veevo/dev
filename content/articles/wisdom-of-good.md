When, in antiquity, someone wanted to kill a bear, they hung a heavy tora
wooden on top of a canister with honey.

The bear pushed the tora hard in order to keep her away from honey. The tora came back and
hit him.

The bear was angry, fierce, and pushed the tora even harder, and this
it in turn reached him much more forcefully.

That kept going until the bear was killed.

                                   *   *   *

If we fixate on this fact, in a quick and unpretentious reflection, we could
affirm that we do the same when we pay evil with the evil we receive from the
Other.

We think then: Do we human beings cannot be wiser than
the bears?

We push the tora more and more forcefully, even though we know that she will return and
hurt us!

God's laws - in particular the law of cause and effect - are very precise in
reveal this characteristic of its.

All our actions are causes that will generate a consequence in the world.

When we reciprocate, with an altered and angry voice, an aggressive word that
hurts the intimate, we're just pushing the tora, and forgetting the honey.

In this analogy, honey would be understanding with the other, happiness, peace that
we both wish.

Only we commonly get so entertained with the jerks of the tora, that we're done
leaving honey, happiness, forgotten in a corner.

The bear's goal will never be to push the tora. Your goal is honey, food. The
is an obstacle to circumvent, a challenge only.

If the animal could reason as the human being, in this particular situation,
would certainly think of a way to cut the rope that holds the tora, or in a
how to remove the honey pot underneath it.

This is the wisdom of good. Look for an alternative other than to repay the
evil with evil.

The wisdom of good provides, as we receive bitter words, a small
reflection before the impending reaction.

The wisdom of good seeks to understand the moment of the other, the pain of the other, the
anguish and intimate unhappiness that moved him to release through his mouth the poison that
guard in the soul.

The wisdom of good is never conniving with evil, and not even tolerant of it.
He is, yes, understanding of the other being, tolerant, indulgent with his brother.

The wisdom of good requires creativity, so that we can open our minds and
think of other solutions to solve our problems, other than revenge.

Revenge will always be the most reactive, least thought-out action, and which will bring, without
doubt any doubt, the tora back to hurt us so many and so many times.

The wisdom of good requires love. Love for life, for the Creator, knowing that
no disaster, no evil catches us for no reason.

Only those who love the Creator trust their designs, trust that everything happens to
our good and thus does not cultivate hatred for his opponents on Earth, just
Compassion.

Only the wisdom of good can eliminate the vicious circles in which we
we have imprisoned over the millennia.

Only the wisdom of good in action will drive war, hatred and
Violence.

                                   *   *   *

The true teaching of love is strong: it kills evil before evil can
grow and become powerful.
