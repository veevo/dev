In a well-known Gospel passage, Jesus states: I ask and receive, Seek and
you will find, Batei and open.

Asking, seeking and beating are the three imperatives of Christ's recommendation.

The problem is to wisely apply these commands.

Human existence is not always quiet. It's often not easy
identify the correct conduct.

In the face of the claims and values of the world, the boundary between right and wrong
vanished.

Worldly invitations are very seductive and present themselves as something reasonable.

Denying them sometimes seems foolish submission to too rigid habits.

It's between duty and will.

In this clash, reason, not often, is impressed by the examples of others and
presents duty as old-fashioned conduct.

The idea arises that if everyone does something, that should be normal.

The problem is that no one is born on Earth to follow distorted examples and
live exotic fantasies.

All men are Spirits and their natural abode is on the spiritual level.

When reborn here is to fulfill programs to overcome old vices and
development of various virtues.

The purpose of the existence of land is transcendence, never the adoption of
more appropriate behavior to irrational animals.

Although worldly conveniences appear certain habits as acceptable,
nor therefore they fail to compromise spiritually who adopts them.

Examples of distorted conduct are the most diverse.

There is sexual experience separated from affective bonds and a proposal of
common life.

There is also the dishonesty of any order, indifference to the
moral or material abandonment of elderly or sick parents.

Although it is tried to justify itself with new values, with the rush of modern life,
there is no argument that converts frivolous and unworthy acts into commendable conduct.

In this tangle of struggles and doubts, it is appropriate to reflect on the three imperatives
of Christ's exhortation.

You have to learn to ask for ways of liberation from the old chain of bad
Habits.

It is necessary to forcibly desire the output of the dark circle in which most
creatures lose the vision of eternal interests.

After asking with correction, you impose yourself on the search.

The act of seeking is a selective effort.

The world remains full of lower requests, but it is urgent to locate the dignified action
and liberating.

Many pursue dangerous mirages, such as moths that fall in love with the
clarity of a fire.

It is appropriate to learn to seek the legitimate good, the desire to be better, to overcome ones,
to transcend.

Established the uplifting script, the time comes to knock on the door of the
Building.

Hitting has the sense of methodical and continuous effort.

Without persistence, it is difficult to transform human experiences into factors of
liberation for eternity.

It is not enough, therefore, to ask aimlessly, to seek without analysis and act without objective
High.

It is urgent to ask Heavenly Father to deliver the past from misunderstandings.

But it is also necessary to seek noble activities and locate in them the
redemption effort.

Ask, pick it up and knock.

These three verbs contain a liberation script, intended for experiences
Sublime.

It is only necessary to use them well.

Think about it.
