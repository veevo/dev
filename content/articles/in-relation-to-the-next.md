Living, relating is inherent to the human condition.

For the sake of living in society, we have developed, over the centuries, achievements
civilisations capable of making mutual coexistence smoother, more
Nice.

Thus, today it is no longer acceptable for waste to be thrown on public roads. In
Middle Ages, however, this was commonplace. Considered common behavior.

Today, it is part of education to respect public places, such as
buildings, gardens, parks, public transport, school.

This is our first positive movement in relation to others: education.

We act politely when we cede the place to the elderly in transport, so
like when we respect people's queue and turn, anywhere.

However, thinking about the next one, we can go a little further.

For example, in addition to polite, we can be nice.

So if we're polite to greet the supermarket cashier, we can be
nice if we greet him with a smile.

We're nice when we ask the doorman How are you?, extrapolating the
education that asks us simply to greet you.

Sympathy creates bonds of relationship with our neighbor, which mere education does not
demands and civilization does not oblige.

However, we may not just be nice, nice. In some
moments, life suggests that we be more than that.

It is the invitation to serve ourselves in empathy, this exercise of putting ourselves in the
place of the other to understand their difficulties.

Empathy is precisely born from the emotional understanding of difficulties and
other people's problems.

With empathy, we judge less and understand more because we understand the
limitations and circumstances of the next. As a consequence, we will have a look
sweetest to him.

Even the most unpleasant reactions of the other will reach us more
mild, with lower intensity.

And in addition to empathy, it is possible to further strengthen our bonds, in relation to
to the next one.

In this sense, the noblest movement we can exercise is compassion.

If empathy is understanding, compassion is action.

Taken with compassion, we are able to extrapolate our interests in order to
act for the benefit of the other without any personal gain.

In compassion our movement is to minimize the pains of those who suffer, physical
or morally.

Compassion is the dynamics of love put into action.

Education, sympathy, empathy and compassion are loving movements.

As we exercise them, let us remember that there is always a level above, where we can advance
in the intimate conquests of our soul.

If we are polite, add to our behavior sympathy.

If sympathy is already our achievement, let us go through the steps of empathy.

If we already understand each other in their difficulties, let's move forward trying to
minimize them, taken with compassion.

In this way, little by little, we will move forward, in the great challenge that proposes to us
Jesus, to love others as ourselves.
