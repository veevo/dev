Perfection is still a very distant state of humanity.

All the inhabitants of the Earth have moral fissures and make mistakes.

In fact, making mistakes is not a scandal in the context of Divine Laws.

God did not create the perfect creatures, but perfectible.

Spirits embody and reincarnate endlessly to develop virtues
whose potential they bring in their hearts.

In order to grow in will, wisdom and love, they have free will.

If they couldn't make options, they'd be simple puppets.

As you can choose, it is natural that they are not always happy in their acts.

The other side of this learning process is responsibility.

By developing consciousness and will, the influence of primitive instincts
declines and freedom expands.

The creature becomes increasingly responsible for its acts and thoughts.

Misconceptions are natural for those who move from ignorance to wisdom.

It is only necessary to repair all the damage caused.

That is why it is a sign of immaturity refusing to admit the
mistakes themselves.

Humility is an assumption of learning.

Anyone who imagines himself infallible and superior to all remains stagnant.

To tune in with life, attention must be paid to the law of progress.

The whole universe is dynamic.

Animal and plant species are constantly perfected.

Even the physical configuration of the Earth is not static.

In the same way as the lower species, man plays a role to
play in the Creation concert.

He is inserted into nature and must be an agent of progress.

But to drive progress it is necessary to be constantly evolving.

Thus, in order not to betray the mission of its existence, propose to be increasingly
Better.

Admit her imperfection, but don't settle for her.

Sometimes you make a mistake, but that's normal.

Take care to learn from your mistakes in order not to repeat them countless times.

And also assume the consequences, good or bad, of your deeds.

Notice all the damage you may cause.

Pay your debts, apologize, pull yourself in front of your fellow men.

It is undoubtedly necessary some effort to recognize a misunderstanding and rectify the
own way.

But you will live forever.

I certainly want to be a wise and pacified person someday.

Since no one will do their job, try hard enough to be like this.

By refusing to admit a misunderstanding, you delay the realization of your luminous
Destination.

Get into your role as an apprentice and show goodwill towards life.

Don't cling to small things like vanity and pride.

Such moral fissures only congratulate him.

Learn to do good without any personal interest or hidden feeling.

Love and respect life, be noble and supportive.

At first some discipline may be required.

But over time you will incorporate that way of living and you will be a person
Wonderful.

Here's a goal worth fighting for.
