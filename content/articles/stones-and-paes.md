It is said that Friar Bartholomew of the Martyrs lived to serve. It was Portuguese, from
city of Braga.

A certain time, in the community in which he offered his work, resolved
build a monumental cathedral. A temple of great proportions, which could
shelter crowds.

To this end, the nobles gathered and agreed to contribute annually to
high sums.

Construction started. The columns, the walls, the walls, reached the ceiling.

It was then that Friar Bartholomew realized that a crisis had reached the country,
reaching the people. The less fortunate fought against hunger, misery,
Diseases.

As head of that religious community, he had at his disposal all that
money raised, whose administration was competing with it. Especially, of course,
for the construction of the cathedral.

That year, he left the cathedral standing still. She had a roof, she thought. Could
Wait.

The nobles, however, continued to deliver high sums. In the second year,
construction continued to stop. Also in the third, in the fourth, in the fifth.

Ten years later, the cathedral was the same way. No getting ready.

Although they trusted Friar Bartholomew, the nobles gathered, organized a
committee and six of them went to talk to Friar.

Friend of all, he received them fraternally and listened to them. Finally, he replied:

According to my accounting, there are more than 2,000 families in
Need. As a spiritual father of all of them, I cannot allow my
children starve. Everything has been spent on our own people.

One of them said, But Friar, you're sure to help these creatures.
I could take a small percentage of the sum we deliver.

The old Friar sighed, lifted his shoulders, joined his hands and replied:

You make me a very curious offer. Take a good look. It reads in the Gospel
that Jesus in the wilderness was invited to turn stones into breads.

You, however, are asking me precisely the opposite: that I
turn bread into stones.

                                   *   *   *

You were right for the pastor of those souls. Human life deserves us all respect.

When talking about right, the first of every creature is to live.

Therefore, feeding bodies, providing the basic needs of our brothers and sisters
constitutes not in charity but in brother's duty to his brother.

                                   *   *   *

All of Jesus' morals is summarises in charity and humility, that is, in both
virtues contrary to selfishness and pride.

With regard to charity, the Master of Nazareth is not limited to
recommend it. He clearly places it as an absolute condition of happiness:

Come, blessed of my father, possess by inheritance the kingdom that is prepared to you
since the foundation of the world.

Because I was hungry, and you fed me to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me to drink. Was
foreign er, and you stayed me.

I was naked, and you dressed me. I got hurt, and you visited me. I was in prison, and I was
You went to see it.

In fact I say unto you, when you did it to one of these little brothers of mine, the
I did it myself.

And synthesizing the lesson, he recommended, Love each other. Practice good without
Ostentation. I will do to others what you would want them to do to you.
