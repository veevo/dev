When we hear of gratitude, a strong, mixed memory of longing, in the
acode to thought.

We remember a child we know. From a young age, i had a
physical problem, which made her suffer much.

However, he woke up in the morning, with effort sat in bed, joined the
little hands and said:

Lord Jesus, thank you for waking up on this day and being able to see the sun.

Upon receiving meals, medicines, care, expressed his
thanks with positive words.

And at night, when he was prepared to sleep, he would talk to Jesus again.

Then she made a special request. I wish that while your body was
asleep, she could run on the sand of the beach and feel the blessed air
Marine.

We asked her once if she really went to the beach in her sleep.

Smiling she replied:

Of course i do, they're the most beautiful moments of my life!

When my sick body sleeps, I can go where I want to go.

She thrilled us with her way of understanding her problem and, at the same time
to have discernment to fully enjoy their freedom as a
Spirit.

                                   *   *   *

It is up to us to have much gratitude for the life that God has given us, for the family, for the
home, by bread, by air...

To be grateful for the parents who allowed us to be born and cared for us, who
gave the opportunity to study, work.

Thank you for getting up every morning and dedicating ourselves to the activities that
life offers us; because we can fill out, during the day, another page of the
book of our life; because we have in our hearts the teachings of Master Jesus,
Model, Guide and Friend of all hours, which positively directs us in
our journey.

Thank you for counting on a spiritual guardian who accompanies us
constantly in the function of protector, inspiring us, advising, raising
the mood.

And with one important detail: always respecting our freedom of choice.

Thank you for having a family with whom we can count on in the arduous hours, in the
anguish, uncertainties.

Even when difficult to live with, it is the necessary remedy to cure
our internal evils.

Gratitude for having sincere friends who vibrate with us at happy times and
supported in the hours of needs.

True treasures to whom we do not always properly value.

Gratitude to the teachers who have given us lessons that will resonate in
our souls forever.

Beings we only remember to thank after we go far.

Gratitude for the faith that sustains us, preparing us for the continuity of
walk, after this reality.

This faith that demonstrates to us that the earth is a great educandary where we learn the
value so much wealth we receive, even the diseases and limitations
that hurt us.

Gratitude for the faithful example of souls in ransom, often trapped in a
bed, almost immovable.

But that can, during physical sleep, enjoy the freedoms conferred on the
Always free spirit.
