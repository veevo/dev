He possessed many riches. He had the chests crammed with gold and gems
Beautiful.

The youth smiled at him and his friends always made presents at the banquets.

He'd get used to sleeping on his ebony bed and ivory. Sleep and dream.

In his dreams, the reality of so many victories that he was
enriched the days. And a desire for peace that still did not fruition.

He loved the chariot and hip squeew slaps. Recently bought horses
Arabs, fires. And slaves had attacked him for days.

Everything pointed to victory in the next races in the port of Cesareia.

But the moments of sadness were constant.

Happiness wasn't total. Something was missing. At the same time, he feared losing the
happiness he enjoyed.

So listening to talk about that singular man who walked the roads of the
Galilee, you've been looking for him.

Good Master, what good should I practice to achieve eternal life?

I wish I knew. As I wished. The answer came sound and clear:

Why do you call me good? Good only the Father is.
the commandments, that is, you will not adulterate, not kill, you will not steal, you will not say
false testimony, you will honor your father and mother."

All this I've been watching in my youth. However, I feel that I do not
Just. Deaf concerns torment me. Flames of anxiety consume me.
I miss something!

So - proposes to him the Light - sells everything you have, it breaks it down among the poor.
Come on, and follow me!

The order, the myson of that man echoed in his Spirit. He was an eagle who
desired to reach the heights. And Rabbi would tell you how to use the wings to
fly higher.

Through the young man's whirlwind mind, the scenes of the glories he would conquer pass.
His friends trusted him.

So many expected his victory. Israel would be honored with his triumph.

Yes, he could renounce family assets, but to the treasure of youth, to the
riches of the vanity served, the whims sustained...?

Would it be necessary to give up everything?

The eagle wanted to fly but the wings were broken...

It is remembered the young man who friends wait for him in the city for a banquet
previously scheduled. In a shudder, it rises:

I can't! " Murmur. I can't right now. Forgive me.

And he walked away in strides. Climbing the slope, at the curve of the path, he
Stopped. He looked back. He faltered once.

The figure of the Master draws in the landscape, to the rays of the moonlight. The light looks like
call it one more time.

Undecided, the young man's soul looks like an oscillating pendulum. The eagle still tries to lift
the flight. The weight of the world retains it on the ground.

He decides. With quick steps, almost running, disappears at night.

The Evangelists Matthew, Mark and Luke narrate the episode and say how the
young man retired sad and sorry.

Nor could it be different: he had been given the opportunity to rush into the
ocean of love and he preferred the vain sands of the world.

                                   *   *   *

Divine Friend calls us daily for the conquest of the kingdom of peace.

Some are still like the rich boy. We leave for later, prisoners who still
we are to many questions and personal vanitys.

It is good to analyze what is worth the most: the ephemeral joy of the world or happiness
perennial that we have so much anoint. Then just choose.
