The number of pregnant adolescents grows...

Teenagers are victims of alcoholism.

The number of crimes committed by young people grows...

Increases alcohol and cigarette consumption among adolescents...

This is some of the news that has been printing the newspapers in recent times.

Where did freedom end up?

Youth is synonymous with freedom. That's what young people sing.

Being young is being free, they say.

Do our young people know what it's like to be free?

Or are they seeking freedom by indulging in the yoke of drugs and
Debauchery?

It seems that there is a very big mess in the head of the modern young man, who fights
freedom and surrenderwithout reflection to chemical dependence.

For in the name of this pseudofreedom they squeeze the shackles that will keep them trapped
for a long time.

Of the men of Malboro we once knew and whose outors were shown in
our cities, all have already said goodbye to physical life, and most of them
eroded by varied cancers.

Can't youth distinguish what true freedom is?

As soon as the teenager can, cut the umbilical cord that binds him to his parents.
After all, it's grimace to be called mom's little boy, because it depends on her loving
Protection.

But, does it go to the case is not to be dependent on cigarettes, alcohol or other
Drugs?

Is it not better to follow the guidelines of parents that truly
rather than surrender to the mundane interests of traffickers and
unscrupulous traders?

In the name of freedom, young people surrender to carnaive desires, allowing
pregnancy brings them early responsibilities.

In the name of freedom, they leave their children, generated without responsibility, delivered
themselves, when they don't kill them in their womb yet.

In the name of freedom, they seek cigarettes, alcoholics, of whom they cannot
free, becoming slaves to these free poisons.

In the name of freedom, they allow themselves to be overwhelmed by fury and fall into the meshes of the
crimes.

We ask: is this all freedom or slavery?

What a future can we expect if young people, who are the realisation of the future,
degrade day by day?

With which firm hands we can count on tomorrow, if our young people's are
trembling about the effects of drugs?

Can we count on shiny brains if our young people destroy
your neurons under the action of alcohol?

It is up to parents and educators to great task of guiding and showing new directions
young people today, so that our society does not rot on the ground.

It is up to young people to discern what is lawful and what is appropriate for the true Christian.

In Paul's words, the Apostle, everything is allowed to me, but not everything suits me. There
is the key to those who long to be truly free.

Let us seek physical liberation by limiting appetites.

Intellectual liberation by knowledge of truth, and, finally, freedom
moral by the conquest of virtues. Only in this way will we be sovereignly free.

                                   *   *   *

In most traffic accidents drivers are drunk.

The great incentive to use alcohol arises in the family environment.

Because alcohol is a socially accepted drug, parents do not realize that
are allowing their children to enter through difficult paths around.
