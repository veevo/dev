Some manage to see him only as the historical figure, almost mythical, to emerge
in Palestine, amid the subjugation that Rome imposed.

Others do not go beyond what has him as a folk character, proper for His time,
full of prophets and superstitions.

Many consider him a mythical figure, to be worshipped, when not imprisoned in
temples, having little to contribute to our eat tasks.

Few can understand in depth the meaning of Jesus to all of us.

Pure spirit, never before or after Him, one has managed to sing the glories of
God with such depth and clarity.

Connoisseur of all of us, long ago, he offered us the most appropriate lessons
for building our happiness and fullness.

He conjugated the verb to love in his most varied expressions, leaving His
legacy so that, over the centuries, we could internalize His teachings.

His proposal was so challenging that the powerful and also the populacho felt
bothered by Him, to the point that they preferred Him to crucify Him.

And even today, He proves defiant.

How many of us have the courage to live your message in the days we live?

Although he tells us that the Earth is destined for the meek, we insist on being
violent.

If blessed are those who thirstand hunger for justice, we prefer, often, to do
justice with our own hands, in mechanisms of revenge that we articulate here and
there.

And while His promise of happiness is for peacemakers, we are still one of those
who foster discord and wage daily battles against our neighbor.

It is easy to realize that we still have very little of Christ in our intimacy.

We say Christians, but little of Him and His message we express in our speaking
and acting.

For many of us Christ is still a figure to live in the rites, cults and external
appearances.

Just like those who lived in His time, when they sought to worship God.

He, however, invites us to live lO in essence.

We warn you not to be tombs, washed on the outside and full of rot inside.

The world has never needed Jesus as much as it did today.

By not following His lessons, we bring the soul in disarray, with multiple
difficulties.

We live anxiously because we do not cultivate faith as He taught us.

We are violent, because we do not learn to pacify ourselves with Him.

We are selfish because we do not have to love others and even the enemy, as He
invites us.

And we are proud because we dispense with the lessons of humility that He has
exemplified us.

Thus, in these tumultuous days that we face, let us seek jesus again.

No longer the crucified figure, distant, wrapped in the rites and traditions
that do not fill our souls.

Let us seek the Good Shepherd, who is always ready to support us, we, the sheep
of his flock.
