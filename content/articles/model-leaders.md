Whenever models of leaders, of extraordinary people are presented, it is
common if you hear the comments of those who believe that they can never match:
Oh, but he was a saint. He was exceptional.

However, when researching the biography of these men and women who
highlighted in humanity, in the most varied branches, what we discover is that we do not
were born made, ready.

On the contrary, they have come a long way, in which persistence,
perseverance, personal effort was constant companions.

We remember Gandhi, who is revered as an example of leadership of the
non-violence.

At the beginning of his life, it wasn't like that. His nature and temperament were
Different. Almost the opposite of his Mahatma behavior.

Before going to South Africa, it was violent, selfish, ambitious
and cruel.

As a lawyer, vain and insecure, he wore a European suit, a white shirt of
starched collar, silk tie, high quality shoes, glossyly
Polished.

In South Africa, he lived in a beautiful English village, in an aristocratic area of the
Beach.

I loved the money. He was an authentic Europeanized Indian.

After reading a book by Ruskin, his worldview became.

As he himself stated: That book marked the turning point of my life.

But it was not with ease that he acquired his subsequent calm and serenity. Not
without terrible self-discipline.

He made a conscious effort to change. It began to perform
services, sweep public places, clean latrines.

He became a man of totally diverse nature. And then the
new man, mahatma gandhi.

Different was not with Saul of Tarsus. Proud, he prepared himself in the school of
Gamaliel in Jerusalem to replace the master.

Known for his oratory, he was used to receiving the applause of the world.

He betrayed the patrician's robe, used a car similar to Roman chariots,
pulled by superb white horses.

He dominated the Greek language, in addition to the Hebrew language.

Something similar to currently dressing up with an authentic Giorgio Armani, walking
bmw and express yourself, with ownership, in the English language.

Passionate and indomable temperament, rich in sharpness and resolution, aspired to a
bright future for himself.

A staunch supporter of mosaic law, pursued the followers of Christ,
establishing terror.

After his encounter with Jesus, at the gates of Damascus, he changed.

The tribune became a slave of duty, an apostle of love, into a defender
of truth.

Nothing was easy for him. It was three years in dan's desert, where he had to exercise
anonymity, humility, until he reconciled with his persecuted.

Then it was the learning in Antioch, the service anonymous to the similar, the
listen, study, reflect.

The return to the tribune, now without pomp and without pride, for the defense of the Good News,
had to be patiently awaited.

Only then does the great Paul of Tarsus come, who in such a way lived the teachings of
Jesus who could say: I am no longer the one who lives, it is the Christ who lives in me.

Effort, perseverance, will.

Let us learn from these creatures. They did it. We'll make it too.
