The Journal Circulation of the American Heart Association published a study,
carried out by a team from the University of North Carolina in the United States
United.

The title was very suggestive: Truth: anger kills even. And he said of the increase
risks of having a heart attack due to bad mood.

The team, for six years, studied nothing less than the behavior of
13,000 men and women, aged between 45 and 64 years.

The researchers found that people who get angry intensely, and with
frequency, are three times more likely to suffer a heart attack,
than those who face problems with more serenity.

According to these scholars, every time the person has an episode of anger, the
body throws in the blood an extra load of adrenaline.

Concentration of this hormone in the body increases the number of heartbeats
and narrows the blood vessels, which causes blood pressure to be increased.

The repetition of moments of anger can generate two problems that are associated with the
Infarction. The first is cardiac arrhythmia, which means that the heart beats
unwisely.

The second is the dilation of fat plates that, by chance, exist in the
Arteries.

For all this, it's good to look at our deeds.

For example: bad mood is presenting itself in our lives in an almost way
Constant?

Let us try to examine its origins so that we can liquidate it as far as possible
possible fast.

If the problem is of any debt that is worrying us, we remember
that it won't be in a bad mood that we're going to get the resources to pay for it.

If difficulty is a disease that torments us, keep in mind that
disease needs medicine and not intolerance, to heal.

If we are in need of someone's cooperation for an enterprise, a
task, it will certainly not be presenting a frown that we will be able to
sympathy and help.

If you're experiencing setbacks in the family, they won't be rough phrases,
full of bitterness and ill will that will solve them.

All this means that, in fact, to this day one is not aware of
no one who sours and bad mood have aided him.

Therefore, it is best to try to get rid of this destructive posture, cultivate the
patience and learn to smile.

*   *   *

No one can accomplish anything without others and others are not
guilty of our failures.

Let us face the new day, willing to win, conquering the good space that
is reserved not world.

Goodwill towards others will always return to us in a climate of
sympathy and camaraderie.

So, starting today, put beauty in our eyes in order to look at the
life with lighter lenses, freeing us from the negative impressions of the night
Passed.

We will then notice that our intimate state will renew itself and everything will take a color
pleasant around us.
