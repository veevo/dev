What do you do that day when everything seems to go wrong?

Some say, I got up on my left foot.

It is understood that those who speak so believe that one foot is more valuable than another.

Forget that both feet are precious, for the basis on which
the weight of the body falls, sustained by the legs.

Anyway, on that day when everything must go wrong, because it started wrong, the
what to do?

First, repel the idea of a persecution of God to His children.

Things don't go wrong because God wants to.

They go wrong because we, Your children, act wrong.

See. Did you get up late in the morning? Whose fault is it?

It's not the alarm clock, it didn't sound the alarm, or it sounded later.

The question is yours, because you're the one who programs the functions of the device.

So there's no reason to get angry. What happens then for the best or
for the worst, it's your decision.

You can get up from a jump, stand up, go out to the toilets of the room and... If
knock on the door, on a mobile.

I thought nothing would bring back the minutes past, i'd get up calmly and
I'd do anything with more wandering.

When you're in a hurry and try to do several things at the same time, you have
very likely something unpleasant will happen.

The milk overflows, dirtying the stove, you cut yourself when shaving, the button of the
shirt falls, for the violence you wear, trying to button it.

Anyway, the list is almost endless. And it's definitely not God's fault.

Do everything calmly. Won't the car start?

Check why and resolve, if possible, without stressing.

Did you miss the bus schedule?

Remember that your anxiety or irritation won't make the next one get ahead.
Hope.

If necessary, notify your superior, your boss, your client, of the delay.

If you're going to miss a class, you've lost. What's the point of yelling, getting mad?
Nothing will bring back the lost minutes.

The word already says: lost.

Is traffic congested? Don't do nonsense, don't violate the rules of good
Driver.

Always have a book, a magazine and enjoy the time.

Did the rain surprise you on the way? Wait a minute. Everything goes away. The rain also
Passes.

Waiting a while shouldn't cause you more concern.

Anyway, in everything be responsible and think that in your hands is allowing everything
walk on the axes, or don't walk.

Everything is resolved, little by little, or not.

Finally, think: it's not worth losing precious minutes of life for stress,
irritation or impatience.

God wants your happiness. Collaborate with Him in this achievement.

                                    *  *  *

Everything in the Universe translates harmony, precision. Planets obey their
trajectories and each one falls, in the line of duty that is proper to it.

The stars spin, the stars shed their light into space. Everything obeys the Great
Father of all of us.

Let's not be different. Let's get in the way.

Let us collaborate with our own happiness.

And let's think every day: Today everything's going to work out. Perfectly right.

I'll do everything i can to make it happen right.
