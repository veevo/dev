The boy was in charge of arriving early every day, and lighting the
old-fashioned stove, in order to warm the room, before the arrival of the teacher and the
Colleagues.

It was a rural school and every day, the boy met his obligation.

One morning, when the teacher and the boys arrived, the school was in
Flames. The boy was removed unconscious from the building. He liveser than Alive.

From his bed, he could hear the doctor telling his mother that he had not
chances of living. Dying would be a blessing to him, for the fire had razed
the entire bottom of your body.

But the brave boy decided he would live. So much fought that he survived.

Then again he heard the same doctor telling his mother that he was
condemned to live as an invalid. Its lower limbs were
Unused.

Again, the boy made a decision: he would walk again, no matter what
Cost.

Unfortunately, from the waist down, he had no motor control. Your
thin legs were hanging there, useless.

When he was discharged from the hospital, his mother took him home. Every day, she
massaged his legs. But he didn't feel anything.

No sensation, no control, nothing. However, he did not give up. He wanted to go back to
Walk.

One day, his mother put him in the wheelchair, and took him to the yard, so
sunbathing.

He stood there, looking at the fence, a few meters away. So if you threw yourself to the ground and
dragged by the grass, to the fence.

With an immense effort, he clung to her, got up and began to drag himself,
stake after stake.

I was determined to walk. You did it every other day until you've flattened a
way, around the yard, by the fence.

He wanted to walk. And I'd walk. He'd give life back to those legs.

Finally, after daily massages and a lot of determination, he achieved the
ability to stand, take a few steps, though faltering.

Finally, walk. He started walking to school. Soon, he decided that
would come running. For the simple pleasure of running.

Many years later, in college, he joined the track and field team.

Later, this young man who no one expected him to survive, who they said never
would walk again, let alone run, broke the world speed record in
a mile race at Madison Square Garden.

His name: Doctor Glenn Cunningham.

Determination has to do with will. And triggered will is sure of goal
Achieved.

For this, however, some factors such as real desire are needed
of wanting, the persistence in the implementation of the programme that is established and the
objective to be achieved.

Thus, if we have a noble goal, let us pursue it without tiredness, guarding the
sure we will achieve it at some point.

Important: let's forget phrases like I can't. Or I don't have much strength to
will as much as you would like.

It's about wanting to, working for conquest, persevering to the end.
