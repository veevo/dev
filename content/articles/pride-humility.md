You must have heard the word humility many times, haven't you?

That word is widely used, but not all people can understand their
true meaning.

The term humility comes from humus, a word of Latin origin that means earth
fertile, rich in nutrients and prepared to receive the seed.

Thus, a humble person is always willing to learn and let sprout in the
fertile soil of his soul, the good seed.

True humility is firm, safe, sober, and never shares with the
hypocrisy or with pieguice.

Humility is the noblest of all virtues because only it predisposes the
his bearer, to real wisdom.

The opposite of humility is pride, because the proud denies all that the
humility defends.

Pride is superb, thinks it is superior and hides behind false humility
or the silly vanity.

Some examples may make our reflections clearer.

When, for example, a humble person makes a mistake, he says, I was wrong,
for your intention is to learn, grow. But when a proud person commits
a mistake, says: It was not my fault, because it is above any suspicion.

The humble person works more than the proud and for that reason has more time.

A proud person is always too busy to do what is needed. The
humble person faces any difficulty and always overcomes problems.

The proud person gives excuses, but does not realize his obligations and
Backlog. A humble person commits and accomplishes.

A proud person thinks he's perfect. The humble person says, I'm good, though
not as good as I would like to be.

The humble person respects those who are superior to him and tries to learn
something with everyone. The proud resists those who are superior to him and treats
to make them defective.

The humble always does something more than his obligation. The proud does not
collaborates, and always says: I do my job.

A humble person says, There must be a better way to do this, and I will
Discover. The proud person says, I've always done it like this and I'm not going to change my
Style.

The humble person shares his experiences with colleagues and friends, the
proud keep them to yourself, because he fears competition.

The proud person accepts no criticism, the humble is always willing to hear
opinions and retain the best.

Who is humble grows always, who is proud is stagnant, deluded in the false
position of superiority.

The proud is sceptical, because he thinks there can be nothing in the Universe that
he doesn't know. The humble reveres the Creator every day because he knows that
there are many truths that you still don't know.

A humble person defends the ideas he deems noble, regardless of who
they come. The proud person always defends his ideas, not because he believes
in them, but because they are yours.

Finally, as can be seen, pride is shackle that prevents the evolution of
creatures, humility is key that opens the doors of perfection.

                                   *   *   *

Do you know why the sea is so big? So much? So powerful?

It's because it was humble enough to put up a few inches below
all rivers.

Knowing how to receive it, it became big.

If i wanted to be the first, if you wanted to stay above all the rivers, it wouldn't be
sea, it would be an island. And i'd certainly be isolated.

Think about it!
