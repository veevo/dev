Today have many facilities.

The media let us know everything that happens in the world, in the
moment it's taking place.

With computer connections, anyone can navigate the world only
triggering some keys.

Newspapers and magazines arrive in our homes, without having to leave for
buy them.

Through cable and satellite TV, various television channels from all over the world
are within our reach, we just have to activate some buttons.

The telephone delivery service is well accepted by the population.

Increase offers and products. Flowers, medicines, food and so many others
goods arrive at our doors after slight phone call.

It is the facilities that, without a doubt, progress has brought to comfort
General.

However, very careful that such amenities do not become
idleness, in laziness.

Violent idle accommodation the moral character of man and disarticulates the fibers and
organic muscles intended for movement, action.

Man's destiny is to constant progress.

It's great that we take advantage of the facilities offered to us in the field
material, but it is urgent that we seek to reach new steps in the field
spiritual, ethical and moral.

It is important that we know how to use well the time that technology saves us.

More will be required of those who have the most. It's Jesus' statement.

All the benefits offered to humanity are allowed by divinity, and
should serve as a means of achieving true progress, which is based on the
intellectual and moral improvement.

Let us therefore fight so that we are not dominated by accommodation. Seek
develop the lasting values of good, honor, honesty,
goodness, dignity, useful culture, knowledge.

These observations also serve our children. Let's take care that you don't
fall into the meshes of laziness, marasmus.

Let us encourage uplifting reading by teaching them to read a book for the first
instead is to meet a new friend. Reading a book for the second time is finding a
old friend.

With all our affection, we show you that we are all part of a society,
and that we are interdependent.

For the construction of a better society, we must all contribute to
actively with our brick of love, albeit small, but of
Importance.

Make good use of the hour's treasure, for us and for the benefit of those around us,
this is the great decision that is up to us.

Exercise the soul by disciplined emocões, training patience, forgiveness,
humility, so that our profile may be consistent with our superior longings.

Anyway, make light in our intimacy and ward off the darkness of the warmness
sassy, who fears making himself present in our lives.

Says a Chinese proverb that there are three things that never come back: the arrow cast,
the word pronounced and the opportunity lost.

For all this, say no to idleness.

                                    *  *  *

Even if our body is inert, thought never stops.

That is why many people who do not give in to the accommodation and
marasmus, they are lucid despite the aging of the physical body.

On the contrary, those who think that nothing else can do and properly give their
stage, have atrophied brain and sclerosis manifests earlier.

So it matters that we keep our brains and hands always busy, with things
so that lucidity never abandons us.
