Die. From this fate, no human being will escape. And yet, as we fear
that moment! With what pain most of us think about the instant of death.

It's just that we were taught to fear death. It is presented to us as synonymous with
tears, an instant of darkness, definite separation from loved beings.

Abyss and sadness. We learn that death is made of mourning and mysteries, fog and
Miss.

But you have to prepare for the arrival of the final hour. After all, every day
reduces our stay on Earth.

Since we were born, each breath marks the decrease in our time in the
Planet.

Because the rhythm of material life involves us, almost without realizing it, we fail to
side the reminder that we walk another step towards death.

The end is only of the physical body, for the soul – the essence of who we are – this
will exist forever. The centuries will run, but we... we will survive.

On this long road that is life, we will greatly learn. Other loves,
relatives, places and situations will enrich our experience.

And many other bodies will serve as an instrument for our learning.

So no too much attachment to the body. He's very important, but he's a
working tool. In it we have only one helper for our education.

With the help of this body, we live on Earth, build a family and
we relate to other human beings. It is essential for life in society
that circumvents our Spirit.

It's just that in contact with other people we have the opportunity to exercise
patience, tolerance, solidarity and ethics.

Finally, put into practice gestures and situations that are pure manifestations of love.

And this is not the greatest goal of our lives: to discover, exercise and experience the
Love?

There is nothing to fear in death when life is full in love, when the days are
fragrant by goodness, when consciousness is straight and duty fulfilled.

Who lives like this - with a quiet heart and planting joys - awaits that the
life fulfills its natural cycle.

For this one, the time of death is serene. It will open the portals of a new world, full
of discoveries: the House of the Heavenly Father.

A good man dies as someone resting after a day's job as well
Done. You have no attachment to anything, for you know you must give God back everything that
Received.

Renewal is the general rule of nature. When death comes, it's time to
return to the world the fragile body, which will blend into the waters and earth.

It will be consumed, it will feed microorganisms. Other beings will live from
Gave.

And the man who used that body will be far away: he will open his arms to infinity.
Your eyes will behold stars, lights, colors and shapes never dreamed of.

You'll keep your heart at a party. Ready for new experiences, willing to
learn and love.

The poet Rabindranath Tagore, Nobel Prize in Literature, wrote about the
death itself:

It's time to leave, my brothers, my sisters.

I've already returned the keys to my door

And I give up any right to my house.

We were neighbors for a long time

And I got more than I could give.

Now it's going to be up to the day

And the lamp that lit up my dark corner, went out, came the subpoena and
I'm ready for my journey.

Don't ask what I take with me: I follow empty-handed and confident heart.
