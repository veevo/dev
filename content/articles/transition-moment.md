Higher Spirituality reports that the Earth is in the process of
Transition.

Soon, she will have altered her cosmic eduction.

For now, it functions as a world of evidence and atonements.

In it they internintellectually evolved spirits, but with remarkable problems
Moral.

Still vicious and full of passions, they need painful experiences to
awakening one's own sensitivity.

However, soon, the Earth will pass the world of regeneration and peace.

For a long time this modification has been prepared by cosmic order.

There was a significant acceleration of material, technological and scientific progress.

Ideals of freedom, equality and brotherhood spread across the planet.

In terms of ideas, everything is prepared.

It remains that the conduct and feeling of human beings fit these
higher purposes.

Let the scandals of selfishness and pride cease.

Let the public and private wars end.

That animosity is extainted, defamation, disloyalty.

Customs need to be purified and improved.

May honest work emerge as a blessing.

That the instruction be made possible for everyone and everyone estimated and taken advantage of.

In this process of transformation, various crises arise.

Some persist in attachment to old vices, such as laziness and dishonesty.

In the face of such a clash of values, it is necessary to position itself.

In order to deserve to live in a regenerating and peaceful climate, one must love peace and
regenerate, by abandoning old trends.

Cruel, lazy, dishonest and indifferent to the pain of the fellow will not have
affinity with this new social context.

Hardened creatures need to be worked out for deep pain in order to
have awakened their sensitivities.

In a warmer world, they find no resources of evolution.

Consequently, their next revivals will occur on other planets,
more primitive.

Precisely for this, a moment of profound definitions lives on Earth.

Every man must decide what he wants for himself in terms of a roadmap of evolution.

The spectacle of other people's dishonesty serves as an excuse for conduct
Similar.

It is necessary to choose between dignity and indignity.

The time of indecision is passed.

It is necessary to define the very standard of conduct, in the context of a rapidly
modification process.

Depending on the decision, the destination will be traced.

It is free will shaping the future in all its perspectives.

Think about it.
