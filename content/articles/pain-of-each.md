From the corner where she was, the doctor admired the young woman, with discretion.

She wore light dress, wore short hair and her green eyes colored the
face without makeup.

He had a cup of tea in the interval before the second act of the opera.

Suddenly, his thoughtful air transfigured into a smile that lit up the room.

Delighted by her, the young doctor only realized the reason for her joy
when a blond boy came close to her enough to kiss her.

In that beautiful hall of the Stockholm Opera House, walls, ceiling and
gleaming gold ornamentations, Dráuzio observed the couple.

The boy wore a dark gray suit, white red neck shirt. Slender body
and traits inherited from viking ancestors, he was up to the beauty of the
Girl.

It looked like a couple of movie artists.

Looking at them, Dráuzio wondered how much difference there was between being born in a
place without poor people, such as Stockholm, and in a working-class neighborhood of São Paulo.

If he had received the same education and was as beautiful as that
Boy, would your life have been easier? Happier?

Alone, in the buzz of the well-dressed people of the golden hall, he felt
Envy.

I wish I'd had the same opportunities and be handsome as that boy.

Sure, just though he's himself. I wish I'd incarnated in that body.

I wish I could enjoy what he had in that cultured country, organized, without
misery close by.

When the opera was over, he returned to the small guest apartment that the
medical institute, where he interned, had given him in.

It rained and he arrived with soaked socks. It was cold.

He thought about taking a hot shower but the shower refused to work.

He warmed up as much as he could and sat next to the heating apparatus,
feeling home and his wife's home.

A few days later, he had in his hands a thick medical record as a list
Phone. It was a severe case of cancer.

Eight years in treatment, the carrier had some improvement. Now, the disease
presented itself in a more aggressive way.

Dráuzio concluded that the only treatment to try would be a new scheme of
Medicines. At least they could control the disease for a while.

It was an incurable illness.

When the nurse opened the door, Dráuzio cost him to believe: the patient was the
cute opera boy.

Like that night, he wore a high-collared shirt to hide the ganglia
jumped and biopsy scar.

                                   *   *   *

In the world of trials and atonements in which we are located, there are no ones who do not have pain
to bear.

Sickness in the home, unemployment, abandonment, relationship difficulties, each
which has its crucible of pain.

No one is exempt from suffering.

Rich, poor, potentated and anonymous, each of which has its burden to bear.

Some are deep and hidden pains, which go unnoticed even by the
family members sometimes.

That is why the Master of Nazareth taught us: In the world you will only have afflictions.
Learn from me that I am meek and humble of heart and you will find reflectors
for your souls.
