Photos and videos from different parts of the world have shown immense damage that the
accumulation of garbage has caused in nature.

Beaches crammed with plastic waste, marine animals and birds killed by
ingested large quantities of these materials, confusing them with
Food.

Others with compromised movements, wrapped in fishing nets, bags
plastic and improperly discarded waste.

We see turtles with plastic straws buried in the nosorines, dying for
Asphyxiation... anyway, a series of scenes that shock and grieve.

Campaigns warn you not to throw these materials on beaches, rivers,
Streets.

Others call on us to stop using plastic materials or reduce
drastically use, and even recycle, reuse, reuse.

Some consider plastic as a villain, however, he is not the real villain. The
plastic cups and straws, for example, helped greatly reduce the
hospital contaminations due to poorly washed and infected glasses,
thus saving countless lives.

The great responsible for the pollution and death of thousands of animals is, in the
truth, the human being, who acts carelessly.

Blaming straws, pots, lids and plastic bags is a way to divert the
responsibility of the real culprit.

When we throw a bullet paper into the street, it will stop at the sewer scan and
will flow into a river and in the sea.

A plastic bag doesn't go of its own free will to the sea. She's an object
inanimate, has no legs or chooses its destination.

Human action, by negligence, is that it puts it on the sea route, and in the stomach of
some hungry animal.

We human beings need to broaden our worldview, going beyond our
around, paying attention to the consequences of our acts, even those that,
at times when we carry them out, they seem insignificant to us.

Year after year, it is necessary to invest resources, which could be used in
other areas, to develop technologies and actions to solve problems
caused by us in different sectors of society.

We found that such technologies have not been sufficient to solve all
the problems that most often arise from our
Irresponsibility.

The issue of garbage is just one of them.

As long as we do not become aware that nature does not exist to serve us,
that we are an integral part of it, as well as plants and animals, we will create
always new and more serious problems.

Abandoning the use of plastic packaging and recycling garbage greatly decreases the
pollution of oceans and beaches.

However, if we remain focused only on us, ignoring the nature that
about, we run the risk of not realizing the problems and still creating
others, severely compromising the existence of everything that has life on Earth.

May we have a more comprehensive, respectful and responsible look at the
nature and that we can develop a sense of responsibility over all
that surrounds us.

Let us think about it because, after all, it is about the survival of all kinds of
life, upon the Earth.
