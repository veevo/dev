What do you do when you have a headache, or when you're upset?

Is there any remedy to alleviate most physical problems and
Emotional?

yes, for a long time we've been looking for something that
rejuvenating, which prolonged our good mood, that protected us against
diseases, which cured our depression and that would relieve us stress.

Yes, something that strengthened our affective bonds and that even in the
help to fall asleep peacefully.

Found! The medicine had already been discovered and was at our disposal. The
most impressive of all is that it costs nothing.

By the way, it costs yes, it's hard to give up a little pride, a little pretense
to be self-sufficient, a little willingness to live the way we want, without
depend on others.

It's the hug. The hug is miraculous. It's really very strong medicine. The hug,
as a sign of affection and affection, it can help us live longer,
protect us from diseases, cure depression, fortify affective ties.

The hug is an excellent tonic. Today, we know that the depressed person is much more
susceptible to diseases. The embrace decreases depression and reinvigorates the system
Immune.

Embrace injects new life into tired and fatigued bodies, and the person embraced
feels younger and more vibrant. Regular use of the embrace prolongs life and
stimulates the will to live.

We've heard, some time ago, a psychologist's very interesting theory
american, saying that if you need four hugs a day to survive,
eight hugs to stay alive and twelve hugs a day to thrive.

And the most beautiful thing is that this remedy has no contraindication and there is no way to
give it without winning it back.

                                   *   *   *

We've seen, glued to the glasses of some vehicles, a very nice sticker,
saying: Embrace more!

Here's a noble proposal: Embrace more.

The physical contact of the embrace is necessary for energy exchanges to be
and so that affection between two people is constantly
Revitalized.

The embrace more is an excellent start for those of us who perceive ourselves a
both away from people, somewhat cold in dealing with others.

Only those who have given or received a sincere hug know how much this gesture,
apparently simple, can tell.

Many requests for forgiveness have been translated into hugs...

Many say I love you have been converted into hugs.

Many feelings of longing were silenced by hugs.

Many emotional farewells sealed an endless love in the warmth of a
Hug.

So we invite you to embrace more.

Donate your tight hug to someone, and immediately get the return of that act
Affectionate.

Use hug therapy against sadness and depression.

Embrace, affectionately, to whom you love and transmit the emotions of this of your
Feeling.

Embrace and convey well-being, peace.

Think about it! Embrace you more too.
