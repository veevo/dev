What kind of information do you feed your mental file with?

If I hadn't thought about it yet, it's worth meditating on the subject, for it's
of his mental baggage that depends on his intimate peace.

When you open the paper early on, what do you usually get first? The
good news, the police page, the sports?

If you get to a waiting room and you notice on the table various types of magazines,
which one do you choose?

When you turn on the TV, what kind of programming do you watch?

When surfing the Internet, what matters are your preference?

From the daily events, the scenes he witnesses, the landscapes he sees, the
that you usually observe more carefully and save in your mental file?

Maybe this seems unimportant to you, but in fact, all this depends
their attitudes, their emotions, their life.

As you think and feel, all your reactions depend on information
accumulates in everyday life.

If you always keep the good, positive, noble part when some situation
He takes assault, will act with lucidity, tranquility and nobility.

But if, on the contrary, it seeks to feed his mind with misfortunes, the facts
human imbalances and disharmony, will have a reaction to
corresponding to your mental environment.

Thus, if you want to maintain, in any situation, intimate harmony, is healthy
seek food consistent with its purposes.

When you open the newspaper, look for something that offers you nice reading,
Sound.

If you can choose from several magazines, choose the one that allows you to
noble reflections that enrich his knowledge about life.

If you have time to surf the Internet, do not stop on the content pages
depressing or dubious content. Don't make your mental files a
Recycle bin.

Try to stop in the best images that make up the landscape through which you pass.

Think that problems exist, that human miseries are a reality, that
the depressing facts pollute the Earth.

But also consider that if you can't change a situation, there's no reason
to load it into your mental file.

For that reason, always seek the best part.

When you get up in the morning, look around you what's best.

Notice the dawn, the colors that nature brings, the landscapes that the day gives you
Offers.

Behold the moon, even though you know that under the moonlight there is violence, injustice,
the pain...

Admire the sunset, even if you fear the dangers that arise with darkness.

Watch the winter carefully, even if the landscape does not seem pleasant to you,
for it is life that sleeps to resurface, even more exuberant, with spring.

Stop a little to observe a child's smile, even if the neglect
with childhood be a reality.

Acting like this, at the end of each day you will have a good reason to thank for the
lived opportunities.

Your intimate life is basically fueled by everything you most
Values.

Thus, if you wish to nourish hope, feed your intimacy with the values
Noble. If you want to build peace, praise it with corresponding food,
always choosing the good part of everything around him.
