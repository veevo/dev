Expressing our thoughts and feelings is a right. However, if the
expose what we think we can offend, harm or humiliate someone, we need
consider whether this constitutes our right.

Our words, whether written or spoken, can cause harm often
irreversible people who listen to them or who read them.

Technology has presented humanity with tools and instruments that
enable faster and more effective communication.

Social networks have emerged as a way to reduce the distance between people,
promote contact, the formation of new friendships.

But while they provided this virtual approach as well
promoted a false sense of protection by anonymity, which ended up
strengthening the perverse side of some creatures.

People began to be attacked for free by their appearance. Others were
threatened and harassed by their sexual orientation, political positioning,
religious belief or ideology.

Believing they would escape being identified, the aggressors spared no
offenses and threats. They didn't know they'd be located and they'd have to answer
by their acts and words, just as they would have answered if they had acted
so on the streets.

The feeling of being better, superior to the other and possessing the truth still moves
proud and selfish people, urging them to assault others, using the
social networks.

A mother posted an outburst, sharing feelings and anguish with those
that she believed to be friends.

Her post was multiplied and she went on to receive stinging reviews, with
harsh and cruel words, of people who did not know and judged her by that
Outburst.

Heated discussions on political positions are putting an end to
friendships, shaking relationships, inciting hatred, threatening lives.

Those who use networks to accuse and offend have often never done so in the
people's presence, fearing their reaction.

However, the feeling of protection they feel, because they are distant
of those they accuse, encourages them.

Without realizing it, end up attracting to your side Spirits of standard
inferior vibratory, which feed hatred, anger, destructive feelings.

And so, real wars are fought with words.

Some have caused deaths. Death of respect, love, of affection that before
nourished relationships.

Death of joy, the will to live and to be what one is.

However, words, when used for good, can build,
cheer, spread peace, light and love.

It is up to each of us to choose what meaning it will give to the words: of life or
Death.

When we're about to say words against our neighbor,
let us remember Emmanuel's guidance:
> Words are agents in building all buildings in life. We throw them
in the direction of others, with the balance and tolerance with which we want
they come to us.
