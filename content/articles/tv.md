What's your opinion on our television shows? The question addressed to
a dozen people will surely reveal a dozen different opinions.
One will say that they satisfy you, another that there would need to be more sport in the
Programming. Someone will say that you want more movies, another will still regret the
Times.

At one point, however, you can find similar ideas. That's what
concerns the excessive dose of violence and sensuality of many programs.

Media outlets such as television, scandalous newspapers,
cinema, scenic art, erotic exploration magazines abound. There are those who
strongly accuses the ethical dissolution of the present day by the
occurrences of the madness of every hour.

The damning system is very old in the world. It is a current way to steal from the
responsibility itself.

No one rules out the unfortunate influence of mass communication vehicles,
however, such vehicles can also serve for the spread of light.

The instrument itself is neither good nor bad. Whoever uses it, who fits it is
that gives you the direction.

And after all, who selects the petty news, who promotes the shows
depressing, who creates and launches the bad programs into the air?

They are men and women, all beings out of this or that family, who
went through an educational institution.

It is concluded, therefore, that the whole range of hallucinations, violence or
pornography that vasa in the world is the product of the human element, uneducated for the
high goals of life.

Souls that thus distill their unfortunate productions were children and young
relegated to moral disorientation, in distant times or in present days. No
are other than our parents, siblings, spouses, friends, children, those responsible
by the deformation of minds, through the various communicator channels.

Faced with the temptation to blame the media as the only
responsible for the dissolution that he sees, let us ask ourselves how we have carried out
our role as educators with the child and the young man.

Have we maintained fidelity to domestic commitments?

We are properly addressing our duties, in the face of life,
demonstrating to our students their seriousness?

We have managed to renounce our own vices and deceptions in order to guide our
little ones on decent journeys?

How long have we spent to watch, with our boys and young people, the
various programmes that constitute their delight?

We have sat with them and proposed an analysis of what they see and hear,
by the various media?

How many do we make of the tv our nanny? Cheap and comfortable. And while we're staying
happy with the ecstasy in which small and adolescent come up with programs that
awaken sensuality, aggression, they are digesting information
immoral, in true brainwashing.

Let's take care of our shoots today while it's time. Let us press for forming them the
character in the legitimate and noble values of Christian life.

So we will not only be caring for our children, our home, but
also collaborating so that soon those who command the programming
radio, scenic or cinematic criteria do so with criteria worthy of
of true art, which excels in good and beautiful.

                                   *   *   *

The child is the living column of the future. It will proceed with the characteristics that you
Draw. It will grow with the righteousness or with the sinuousities that we trace to it at the
Development. You'll give back what you're getting now.
