When you move a fruit peel left by neglect of
someone, does not practice only an act of kindness. Prevents any unsuspecting
slip, suffering violent tumble.

By ceded the place in public transport to an elderly person, you do not make a gesture
courtesy only. Meets a tired body, saving the energies of those who
could be his grandfather or his father.

If you offer assistance in driving any volume, saving the one who
carries it, does not practice only a delicacy. It contributes fraternally to
the joy of someone who rarely finds help.

Using the good word in any situation, you do not exclusively meet the
fineness of the tract. It realizes among the listeners the cult of the verb are, from which they sprout
fruitful and salutary teachings.

Silencing an affront in public, you don't just demonstrate refinement
Social. It saves itself from violent dialogue, which gives rise to hopeless hatred.

If you offer clothing to those in need, not only does it meet human delicacy,
by philanthropy. It expands the culture of pure and simple charity.

By smiling discreetly, giving the opportunity to a disaffection to redo the
friendship, you do not act so-only in tribute to education. Erases sorrows and
resentments, while "you're on your way with him."

Trying to help a tired sick to overcome an obstacle, you don't just act
for the sake of kindness. Cooperates that life is definite in the weakened,
providing him with evolutionary opportunities.

Serving a naughty child who bothers you, in a group of friends, you
is not just in the beauty of external conduct. Free a future man from a
disappointment present.

In the exercise of kindness, the soul expands evangelical resources and lives the precious
teaching the Master to the emphatic doctor of the Law, with affability and sweetness, when
He said, "Go and do the same!"

                                   *   *   *

In the exercise of affability and sweetness, which will attract for you the currents of the
sympathy, use compassion for all and keep, above all, goodwill
and sincerity in the heart.

In joy or pain, verb or silence, stimulus or warning, light
the light of love in the heart.

Sweetness is this kindness of manners, one of the forms of benevolence towards
our neighbor, characterized by the willingness to welcome the other as someone to
who we want well.

It's a courage without violence, a force without hardness, a love without anger.

Sweetness, affability, attract. Hardness, cholera, push away.

                                   *   *   *

Cultivate softness without affectation; and sincerity, without thorns. Only love
know how to be sweet and affable, to understand and help, using situations and
problems, circumstances and experiences of life, to elevate the eternal Spirit
to the temple of Divine light.

If something about the Earth deserves the name of happiness, it's that intimate satisfaction,
that intimate moral feeling that results from the employment of colleges in the
research of truth and in the practice of virtue.

Think about it.
