Many people complain about the rush of their lives.

They think they have too many commitments and blame the complexity of the modern world.

However, countless of them multiply their tasks without real need.

Living with simplicity is an option that is made.

Many of the things considered essential to life are actually
Superfluous.

Strictly speaking, as they search for things, creatures forget their lives.

Distressed by multiple commitments, do not reflect on their reality
Intimate.

They smell what they like, do not think about what brings them peace, while suffocating in
vain searches.

What's the point of winning the world and losing yourself?

If the creature is not careful, having and appearing can take the place of being.

No one needs to change cars constantly, have countless shoes, get out
all end of week.

It is possible to reduce one's own agitation, contain consumerism and rediscover the
Simplicity.

The simple is one that does not simulate being what is not, which does not give too much
importance to his image, to what others say or think of it.

The simple person does not calculate the results of each gesture, has no tricks and
nor ulterior motives.

She experiences the joy of being, only.

It's not about leading an unconscious life, but of finding your own
Childhood.

But a childhood as a virtue, not as an stage of life.

A childhood that is not distressed by the doubts of those who still have everything for
make and know.

Simplicity does not ignore, just learned to value the essentials.

The little pleasures of life, an interesting conversation, look at the stars,
walk hand in hand, have ice cream...

All this makes up the simplicity of existing.

It is not necessary to have a lot of money or be important to be happy.

But it's hard to have happiness without time to do what you like.

There's nothing wrong with money or success.

It is good and important to work, study and improve.

Progress is always a human necessity.

But that does not imply living distressed, while trying to destroy endless
Activities.

If the price of success is no peace, maybe it's not worth it.

Things always fall behind sooner or later.

But there are immaterial treasures that never run out.

Genuine friendships, a cultivated love, serenity and peace of mind are
some of them.

Pay attention to how you spend your time.

Analyze the things you value and see if many of them aren't just a burden
unnecessary in its existence.

Try letting go of excesses.

By opting for simplicity, you might rediscover the joy of living.

Think about it.
