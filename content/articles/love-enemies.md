Is it possible to extend love even to enemies? This sublime feeling,
that makes us sweet towards the friend, which allows us to feel happiness with
your mere presence, is it possible to be directed to enemies?

Love is an inner attitude that expands as with air, which at all
and everyone vitalizes.

Speaking of criminals, the Charity Act says we should have to
they compassion.

It will be possible to commend ourselves for someone who took away our peace, removing from the
our side the beloved husband, killing him in a moment of madness?

It will be possible to love someone who usurped our goods, deceiving us and leaving us
in almost misery?

Looking at the question of those who harm us, it is always appropriate to remember that the
criminal is a sick and in himself already very unhappy.

In addition, we have to consider social, economic and emotional factors that

Plucking the slander's tongue does not notice the evils that the false accusation has already
spread throughout the world...

When love penetrates the intimate of men, hatred, which is a disease of selfishness,
will give way to fraternity and understanding.

That is why Jesus warned: You have heard what has been said to the ancients: you will love
your neighbor and you will bore your enemy. I, however, say unto you, love your
enemies, pray for those who persecute you and slander you so that you may become children
of God upon the earth.

If you love only those who love you, what reward will you have? They don't do it like that.

Love, in any expression, is the presence of the Creator Father sustaining life and
dignifying His creatures.

One day, He shall triumph over all circumstances and govern all
Lives.

In establishing the Law of Love for adversaries, Jesus established the era of
mercy, which would precede that of real love.

He himself lived throughout His ministry the Law of Love and for her gave the
Life.
