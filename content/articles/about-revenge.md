Revenge is a kind of barbaric justice, in such a way that the more the
human nature leans towards it, the more the Law should exterminate it.

Because the first injury does nothing but offend the Law, while the
revenge of injury puts the Law out of its office.

These are some considerations of the English philosopher and essayist Francis Bacon
on this movement of evil revide, which still has so much power in us.

He adds: Certainly, in exercising revenge, man equals the enemy;
but, passing upon her, is superior to her; Because it's the prince's own forgiving.

What passed, passed, and is irrevocable; Prudent men already have enough that
do with the things present and coming; should therefore not worry
with bagatelas like working on past things.

Why should I be resentful of someone, just for the reason that he more
do you love yourself than me? And if someone hurt me, just for pure wickedness,
so this is solely like the rose bush and thistle that sting and scratch only
because they cannot otherwise proceed.

Of these wise placements, which also reflect Christian thought,
we draw very important reflections:

Did you know that when you take revenge, you become the same, or lower than your offender?

Did you know that when you don't accept an offense, or any evil, this evil
remains with whom you created it and does not affect you?

Did you know that when you spend your time, your energies, planning and cultivating
feelings of revenge, no longer produce good?

So it's time we took control of our emotions, to tame our
inferior feelings, realizing that we only have to gain if we stop hating.

This is the beginning of forgiveness.

Maybe you're not ready yet to forgive certain things that you
happened because they are recent or even very traumatic. Don't worry, i'll be right back.

Forgiveness is a process. One step at a time. And the first step deals with the
self-preservation, that is, to take care of their health, physical and mental, because those who
heartache guard is poisoning himself, daily, without knowing.

So the first step is, stop hating.

As the thoughter quoted said so well:

Why should I be resentful of someone, just for the reason that he more
do you love yourself than me? And if someone hurt me, just for pure wickedness,
so this is solely like the rose bush and thistle that sting and scratch only
because they cannot otherwise proceed.

Yes, there are people in such an advanced state of imbalance, sick of the soul, that
can only act that way, unfortunately.

They will still wake up, they will still have to correct themselves and afford their
responsibilities, but it will not be hatred, nor revenge, which will achieve
intent.

So move on... You're bigger than all this. You don't deserve to live
incarcerated in hatred. Think about your health, think of your family, those who love you
Truly. These want to see you well, not get hurt.

It must be greater than revenge, otherwise it will consume us to
Few.
