Nowadays, science progresses giddyly on the planet.

However, as the body's sufferings are suppressed, the
afflictions of the soul.

In countries with a higher social standard, the increasing number of
Suicides.

The newspapers are full of wonderful news about material progress.

Sublime secrets of nature are surprised in the domains of the sea, of the earth and
from the air.

However, the statistics of human crimes remain astonishing.

There are frequent news about marital tragedies, betrayals and abandonments.

There seems to be a lot of thirst for freedom without responsibility.

Creatures allow themselves sad sexual unrest, without atsing as to
possible limits.

In much they are very much available, however, they no longer become peaceful and happy.

On the contrary, sofregas and restless, pass the image of an immense need.

In this wave of follies, new and intriguing illnesses arise, physical and
Psychic.

Strictly speaking, modern man is not prepared to live in comfort.

He increasingly dominates the outer landscape, but does not know himself.

When the needs of the body are met, the needs of the body are imperative
of the soul.

Human comfort tends to increase naturally.

Little by little, man will have more time for himself.

Work will become increasingly intellectualized and efficient.

The democratization of information will also make it possible to question old
beliefs and values.

The problem is to identify what is appropriate, in the face of such a framework, at a time
dangerous and promising.

Paul de Tarsus's reflection resurfaces in the sense that everything is to us
possible, but not everything is appropriate for us to do.

With free hours and internet access, a world of possibilities emerges.

Man can allow himself the greatest rascalities in this virtual environment.

You can get addicted to pornography, participate in low-slang conversations, and
encourage hatred.

However, in compliance with what you decide to live, it will have inevitable consequences.

If you connect with the unfortunate tracks of life, the most unfortunate day it will be.

Thus, in the full use of personal freedom, it is time to decide what
Live.

No longer moved by social conventions, fear or lack of options.

Anything is possible, but it is appropriate to make happy and constructive choices.

Educate yourself, turn your eyes to what is beautiful and pure in the world.

Taking care that hours off are moments of peace and improvement.

Think about it.
