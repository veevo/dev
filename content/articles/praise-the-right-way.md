Recently a group of children went through a very interesting test.

Psychologists have proposed a task of medium difficulty, but that children
would run without major problems. All managed to finish the task later
of a certain time.

Then they were divided into two groups: group A was praised for the
Intelligence. Wow, how smart you are! How smart you are! Boy, who
pride to see how great you are! And other compliments to the ability of each
Child.

Group B was praised for the effort. Girl, I enjoyed seeing how much you
dedicated himself to the task! Boy, how nice to have seen your effort! What persistence
you showed it. He tried, tried, until he did, very well! And other compliments
related to the work done and not to the child itself.

After this phase, a new task of difficulty equivalent to the first was
proposed to both groups of children.

They were not obliged to accomplish the task, they could choose whether they wanted to or not,
without any kind of consequence.

The children's answers surprised. The vast majority of group A
simply refused the second task.

The kids didn't even want to try. On the other hand, almost all of group B
they agreed to try. They didn't refuse the new task.

Explanation is simple and helps us understand how to praise our children: the
human being scares away from experiences that may be unpleasant. Children
smart people don't want the feeling of frustration of not being able to accomplish
a task, because this can modify the image that adults have of them.

If I don't make it, they won't say I'm smart anymore.

The hardworking ones are not afraid to try, because even if they do not succeed is the
effort that will be praised.

However, that's not all. In addition to school content, our children
need to learn values, principles and ethics.

They need to respect differences, fight prejudice, acquire habits
healthy and build solid friendships.

You can't get any of this through fragile praise, focused on the ego of each
A. They must be constantly encouraged to act like this. That's what you do
compliments, feedbacks and incentives to expected behavior.

Our children need to hear phrases like: How good that you helped him, you have
a good heart. Congratulations, my son, for telling the truth even though i'm
afraid... You're ethical.

Daughter, I was proud that you have paid attention to that young girl rather than
have excluded her as some colleagues did... You're supportive.

Praise of this kind is based on real actions and reinforce the
behavior of the child, who will tend to repeat them. That's not a father's tactic,
it's real incentive.

Praising superficially is easier for educators, as such expressions
are almost always standards and do not require reflection on the part of those who say them.

But hardworking parents should not be after easy solutions, but rather from the
best solutions for the education of your sprouts.

Let us learn to praise correctly, reinforcing positive behaviors,
contributing to the formation of good men and women.
