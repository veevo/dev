Love is of divine essence, cry out the Immortals. The man, in rehearsals
of love, has been wrong very often.

In the name of love for truth, strife broke out that have passed years and
have reached many.

For love of eminent personalities, it has hit lives, destroying others
so many lives.

For love to historical places and stops man fights, fought and
Unbalanced.

However, love is of divine essence. From what is concluded that, at the moment
some, for no reason, may become a fractional weapon or reason for
Dissension.

True love simply donates and has no limits.

We remember a young lady, a professional of merit, who
he intersorcied with famous engineer. Fortune smiled at them, fame, the
public recognition. They lived happily, were it not for depression that time or other
he affected his wife. He was taking a lot of sadness and for hours bitterly loneliness.

Nothing that could modify his disposition in those moments. Nor does the
presence of the spouse, family, friends.

It's just that she kept a secret and the remorse tormented her. In the greens
years of youth had become pregnant and, inconsequential, had opted for abortion.

After the marriage, because he could not get pregnant, he came to believe that
the heavens were punishing her for the terrible act she had committed.

But i didn't dare anyone to confide what i had done.

Until one day he decided to open the unknown intimacy of his heart
upon being loved. I was afraid I'd lose him in the face of revelation.

He heard her and taking his hands among his, murmured:
suspected that something serious had happened in his life. I respected your
secret and never loved her less. Now, much more, if a superlative is possible
Love. This is a great and special moment in our lives. The only one has disappeared
impediment that cast shadows on our union.

Do you forgive me?" asked tearful.

Whoever loves, he can't forgive, she answered her husband quickly. The fact that
forgive would nullify the feeling of love, because love always understands.

I regret that your gesture of trust had not taken itself before, for
so prevented me from enjoying the solidarity of suffering by his side,
reducing his pain.

Holding his hands with redoubled tenderness, kissed them: We do not suffer
more the past. We built the future. Let us compensate for the criminal act, supporting the
children of others, if we cannot be parents of their own flesh.

We rehave our strengths in the sublime furnace of love, clarified
for God's sake.

The couple, having by witnesses the stars of the calm night, renewed the
promises of eternal ventura with perennial dedication.

A musical poem of hope and mutual assistance was expressed, in the
soft ballad of love.

                                   *   *   *

Love covers the multitude of mistakes and misconceptions.

This means that serious fouls can be reimbursed with devotion to the
dedication to good and unceasing work for others.

Who sows thorns can come to soften the roughness of the field then
cultivated, starting to aromatize the air with the abundant sowing of flowers
and fruit trees.
