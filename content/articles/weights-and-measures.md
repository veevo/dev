> Blessed are those who thirst for justice, because they will be sated. 

This statement of Jesus makes us wonder if we can include ourselves in the number of those who thirst for justice.

According to dictionaries, justice means compliance with law. Virtue of giving each one what is yours.

Jesus, however, referred to justice by recommending that we do to others what we would like others to do to us.

However, we who have so often charged the Divinity to sacie our thirst for justice, if we look deeply, we are not truly thirsty for justice, in the real sense of the term.

In daily conviviality, we are often surprised by acting unfairly.

The deal with the people around us is differentiated according to the social or financial position, subalternity or authority, that each is invested.

If we go to the service that makes the cleaning, for example, we speak in a certain way, in a tone of voice and attention distinct from what we employ to talk to people who occupy positions who, in our view, are more important.

If the person who is looking for us is dressed in elegant costumes, even if we don't know who it's about, our deference is immediate.

But if you're wrapped in andrajos, very different is our attention.

Another example is when our vehicle begins to show signs that the engine will soon have blown. What's the first idea that comes to mind?

If we were fair people, we would certainly do a good review by repairing the damage and, by offering it to someone in the case of sale, we would tell the buyer the truth.

But what usually occurs is the idea of passing it forward as soon as possible. And whoever buys it that gets the damage. After all, the world is smart, we think.

But we tell ourselves fair people.

If the reverse happens to us, we immediately indignate ourselves at what we call a great dishonesty. How could someone sell us a vehicle about to blow the engine? What injustice!

If we watch corrupt rulers take personal advantages with public resources, we immediately raise our voices to criticize and demand justice.

But how many of us buy fake attestations to deceive the boss and receive full salary?

We use, at various times, two weights and two measurements. And as we know each other, we know why we act that way. We know what our true intentions are.

So we can ask ourselves, do we really have a thirst for justice? Or have weights and measurements only thought of ourselves?

Christ's promise is real and will be fulfilled when we are effectively thirsty for justice, using, as Divine Justice, a single weight and a single measure, impartially.

*   *   *

The superior Spirits recommend that if we have doubts about the procedure we should adopt with someone, put ourselves in this someone's place and do exactly what we would want us to do.

That way, we will never be wrong, since we all want the best for ourselves.

Let's think about it!
