Full harmony still constitutes a distant dream of any organization
Human.

Men keep big differences between themselves.

Several factors induce different ways of understanding and living life.

The education received at home, professional and affective experiences,
teachers and friends.

All these elements contribute to the uniqueness of human personality.

Diversity produces wealth.

If all men thought likewise, marasmus and sameness would take
account of the world.

A heterogeneous assembly or team has great potential.

It turns out that living in harmony with the different presupposes maturity.

In any human relationship genre, it is necessary to respect others.

But you also need to stay focused on a bigger goal.

Every human association has a purpose.

In the professional sphere, we seek the growth of the company in which it is participated.

In the family sphere, the education and preparation of its members for the
life, in a context of dignity.

In a philanthropic association, the practice of good is aimed at.

The clear notion of the objective pursued facilitates coexistence.

The fact that someone disagrees with your ideas doesn't mean they're against you.

The relevant thing is to verify the most efficient way to achieve the desired goal
by the group.

Human coexistence rarely ceases to produce some friction.

But you have to know how to shut up the discord.

If the clash of ideas and positions is not bad, aggressiveness and radicalism
always are.

Think about the institutions you integrate.

Its presence in such environments aims at the collective interest, or the exaltation of
your ego?

It is better to move away from them than, as a petty factor, to be a cause of
destabilization and fights.

But the ideal is to learn to sacrifice your personal interest for a cause
Greater.

If a controversy arises, reflect with serenity on the views
Involved.

If your position isn't defensible, give it up.

Try to be a peacemaker element in the means in which it moves.

There's little as tiresome as a bruise changer.

Certain postures are tolerable only in very young people.

At maturity, systematic rebellion and vanity are ridiculous.

Do not sing your fellow men, with inflexible and unjustifiable positions.

Learn to give in and reconcile when it doesn't compromise your honesty
and his ethics.

What good is it to you to win a debate, if the cause you defend suffers from
Right?

The wise man identifies when to move forward and when to retreat.

But he always does it sincerely and dignifiedly.

It's no use affecting agreement and sowing discord behind the scenes.

Concealment and intrigue are unworthy of an honorable person.

Reflect on this when you become involved in debates and strife.

When engaging in a cause, serve it with disinterest.

Never allow yourself to be used by her to show up.

But especially never harm her by radicalism and immaturity.
