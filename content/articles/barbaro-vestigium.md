> "If someone hits you on the right face, also introduce you to another." Jesus.

The prejudices of the world about what was convinced to be called the "point of honor"
this dark need, born of the pride and exaltation of
personality, which leads man to repay an injury with another injury, a
offense with another.

This thirst for revenge is regarded as justice, in the eyes of those whose moral sense
has not yet developed enough to rise above the terrenas passions.

That's why the Moisaic law prescribed, "Eye for an eye, tooth for tooth," of
according to the time when Moses lived.

Then Christ came and said, "I gave back evil with good."

By proud this teaching will seem cowardice, for he does not understand that
there is more courage in enduring an insult than revenge.

And you don't understand why your vision doesn't go beyond the present moment.

It is clear that Jesus, in giving these counsels, does not condemn the legal repression of
aggressors that should be considered, as it is still necessary.

Nor did he prescribe that if he left the field free to the bad, exempting them from all over and
any reason for fear. If there is no brake on the aggressors, very quickly
all the good will be your victims.

Jesus, in uttering that maxim, he did not intend to say all defense, but
condemn revenge.

Saying that we present the other side to the one who has hit us in a, he said,
in another form, that one should not pay evil with evil.

That man must accept with humility all that is in such a way as to slaughter him
Pride.

What greater might come from being offended than of offending, to bear
patiently an injustice than to practice any.

What better to be deceived than deceptive, ruined than ruining the
Other.

He who desires revenge usually gets entangled in the meshes of the
falsehood and rascality, because it almost never takes revenge in the open.

Take shady paths, follow in the shadow the enemy, who distrusts nothing, and
waits for the opportune time to, without danger, hurt him.

He hides from the other lurking him, prepares him hateful traps and, in being
propitious occasion, pours into the glass the poison.

It is this kind of behavior that Jesus condemns.

Only a civilized society will understand and accept these truths. That's it
will happen with the intellect-moral progress of the peoples.

Revenge, therefore, is one of the last vestiges of barbarian customs, which
tends to disappear among men.

So let us leave justice on account of the laws of men, with the certainty that
crimes with impunity, will be fatally collected in the meshes of divine laws, which
each second his works.

                                     * * *

Divine Justice never lacks. Even if it is not perceived, it realizes its
higher ministry, reaching all those who disrespect the statutes that
govern life.
