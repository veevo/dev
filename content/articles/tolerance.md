Often, in our daily lives, we usually complain about some people who
we serve in stores, supermarkets, on the phone, finally, those that
meet in some way.

What we don't realize is that we're also among these people. And that, like
them, we are also relating to several other people.

We should think twice before we get mad.

Irritation, intolerance, cause us to cause even greater ills in the
society in which we live.

It is the small disagreements that generate the great conflicts of humanity.

Therefore, do not deny consideration and affection before fatigued clerks or
cranky. Think of the trials that undoubtedly torment them in the rearguards
family or home.

The person who proves grumpy, in his public contacts, probably
carries a heavy burden of restlessness and illness.

Learn to ask for a favor from those working in offices, warehouses, shops or
bars is must.

Although they are being paid to fulfill their tasks or are subordinate to
we, are human beings like ourselves.

Remember that all creatures bring with them the imperfections and weaknesses that
peculiar to them, as far as, still misfit, we also bring the
Our.

Often, ourselves, plagued by some problem to solve, we treat
evil someone who comes to us for a favor with delicacy.

What would happen if this person treated us badly too? We'd get even more
Angry. However, if this person, despite our ill will, treated us
Well, with courtesy and kindness, we'd think better about what we're doing,
may even change attitudes.

In many cases, what we lack is a little tolerance.

To have tolerance is to have patience and know how to understand the problems of others.

Tolerance must be applied indistinctly between everyone and anywhere.
It is a living lesson in faith and elevation and cannot be forgotten.

Tolerating, however, does not mean conivir.

To excuse the mistake is not agreeing with him. Understand and forgive offense, not
represents ratifying it, but rather being charitable and understanding.

It is essential not to enter an area of friction when you can get around the evil
apparent in favor of the real good.

Forgive the offenses and try to understand the problems of others without judging them
preconceituosamente.

Do to others what you'd like them to do for you.

Be a friendly person to everyone.

Always contribute a little love to overcome the evil of the world.

                                   *   *   *

Tolerance is charity at first. Exercising it, on a continuity basis, you
will face the excellent results of the good wherever you are, with whom you live.
