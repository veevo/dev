Neide was born in a small town in the interior. She was the oldest of eight brothers and,
therefore, the mother had instructed her to help raise them.

When he turned eight, his father died. Neide had to leave school for
devote herself to the house and the care of minors, so that the mother could work.

She was the one who bathed, prepared the bottles, made the food, changed the
diapers, cleaned the house.

At night, exhausted, lay in bed and dreamed of the day when he could return
a estudar.

Life was hard. The mother could barely earn enough to provide the
needs of children.

They've been hungry and cold, often.

As they grew older, their brothers and sisters were given tasks to perform.
Thus, the responsibility for the house was distributed, relieving a little
load of the girl.

At the age of seventeen, she met the one who would become her husband.

He married and moved with him to the capital.

At first, life in the big city was scary. The young couple was not
accustomed to human wickedness and over and over again was deceived, humiliated,
Pursued.

Neide cried and prayed to God asking for strength, striving not to leave
to the difficulties.

Her husband, a young man of noble soul, knew of his wife's great dream of studying,
and encouraged her.

He got two jobs so she could work less and have time for the
Studies.

Neide went to school every night with the joy of those who will receive a
Prize. I didn't miss any classes.

When your daughter was born, you didn't fade. Her husband took care of the little one so that
she could complete the nursing course.

It was a model of dedication. While some colleagues refused to carry out
tasks they considered less noble, there was no task for Neide to deny himself to
Fulfill. And he did with all due respect to those who were in his care.

On graduation day, teachers and colleagues paid tribute to the student who
taught everyone an important lesson in love, dedication and humility: the
Nurse Neide.

Called to the microphone, she trembled and cried with emotion.

He didn't feel special at all. He had just done what his heart was in charge. What
tell those people who applauded her?

When the applause ceased, he spoke of his childhood, of how he cried at night for
not being able to go to school, nor have what to eat, what to wear and what to wear.

He told of her prayers to God that he would help her realize her dream of
estudar.

I'm sure God heard my prayers. He gave me a loving husband,
who always encouraged me and supported me. And put in my way people who me
Helped.

Every night I thank you for being healthy, being able to work, have to eat, have
a family, have managed to fulfill my great dream.

I think I'm the happiest person in the world and I'm grateful for that.

When it was over, audiences, teachers and colleagues could not contain the
Tears.

They were facing the simplest and also richest person in the world!
