Cintilância is not synonymous with harmony and peace.

There is clarity in the destructive fires that consume lives and goods.

Sinister flush ing appears in the bombings that bring death.

Radio reflexes arise from the flamethrower.

Strange lightning signals the movement of firearms.

In the Gospel, however, it is different.

Commenting on Christmas, the Evangelist Luke asserts that Christ is the light for
illuminate the nations.

The Master did not come by imposing norms on religious thought.

He did not question rulers and governed over political processes.

He did not compete with philosophers about the origins of man.

It also did not compete with scientists in demonstrating partial aspects and
transient life.

He was content to make light in the eternal Spirit.

His ministry addressed the people saroundthe so.

But He did not mark His presence with collective expressions of power.

He refrained from moving and forming armies and priesthood, armaments and
Courts.

He was concerned about what really mattered.

It brought clarity for everyone, projecting it from itself.

He revealed the greatness of the service to the collective through the consecration
personal to infinite good.

                                   *   *   *

In the reminiscences of christmas season, meditate on the script you elected.

What does he lead you to?

Do you have enough light for the march?

What kind of clarity is lighting up in your way?

Escape the fatal glow of the short circuits of cholera.

Don't be content with the vanity lantern that mimics the low-flying firefly
inside the night.

Erase the flames of jealousy and discord that throws hearts at the precipices of the
crime and suffering.

Also do not confuse the Christmas period with the brightness of the ornaments of the shops.

Soon, this flicker will become extinct, but you will remain on your journey.

Take advantage of the usual year-end break to reflect in depth on
your life.

Identify the options that guide you to the paths.

Rationale on the habits you have kept and that reveal your intimate world
for the like ones.

Are they in accordance with the teachings of the Divine Master?

Jesus said His yoke was light and offered His peace.

Subsequently, it proved to be the Way of true life, and made the invitation.

Whoever wanted it should take your cross and follow him.

Taking your own cross and walking with the Master means imitating His luminous
exemplos.

There is no happiness in disturbances and error.

The splendors of terrena life very early produce boredom.

                                   *   *   *

If you seek the Divine Master and the Christian experience, in addition to illusions
of the world, stop and reflect.

Remember that there are flashes on Earth that threaten, disturb, confuse and
announce scumling.

Being a Christian, enjoying His sublime peace, implies cooperating with Him.

To do this, it is necessary to dispose of the darkness, lighting in itself
itself that sublime light to illuminate.

It is essential to have to love and serve, making it a habit, for the
unceasing repetition.

Think about it.
