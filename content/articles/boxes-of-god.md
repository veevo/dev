One night, a man had a dream. He dreamed that he had an encounter with God and,
because if he presented himself very sad, God presented him with two boxes.

One of them was black, varnished and the other of golden color, with a beautiful
ribbon loop.

Put all your sorrows in the black box, recommended the good God. And the
your joys, keep in the golden box.

The man understood and, since that day, proceeded according to the
Divine recommendation.

After some time, he was surprised that the golden box was every
heavier day and the black was still as light as the night she had won it
of God.

Taken out of curiosity, opened the black box. I wanted to find out why I was so
take, if almost every day he put there at least a little sadness.

That's when he saw it. At the base of the box, there was a hole and by it they all came out
their sorrows.

He thought loudly, talking to God:

Why, Dad, you gave me a box with a hole and an entire box, without
no leaks?

The good Father answered from ready: My son, the golden box is for you to tell
blessings. That's why it's closed. The black box is for you to let go
all his sorrows.

                                   *   *   *

Says the popular proverb that sorrows do not rescue debts. That's true. More than
that this, keeping sorrows is extremely harmful to life.

Sadness is a bad counselor, because it empanates the mental perception of those who suffer from him
presence and disturbs discernment.

The presence of sadness produces emotions of suffering, which must be overcome to
renewal effort, so that they do not become bitterness or
disinterest in physical existence.

In the harmonious concert of Creation everything invites to joy. Flora and fauna are a
poem of wonderful structure exalting the Creator.

Although the Earth is a planet of evidence and atonement, it is also a school of
green fields of infinite beauty, perfumes in the air and cascades that
break crystals on the rocks.

In this whole, only man is sad because he thinks and dissatisfaction, the
pride, selfishness, rebellion make him dark, lonely and bitter...

But it is the same act of thinking that lifts man to the splendor of heaven and earth,
waters and lightness of the air, to thank the gift of life in the body, which
provides evolution.

                                   *   *   *

Sadness, when it settles, spreads destruction, thus not deserving
acceptance in our lives.

Let's put it, then, always in the black box, bottomless, not to keep it from a
day to the other, neither from morning to afternoon or evening.

We place, yes, every day, in the golden box of our existence, the
blessings with which God graces us, remembering that only the act of being alive,
that is, reincarnated, it must be a cause for joy, for the excellent
occasions of which the Spirit is available to be fully happy.
