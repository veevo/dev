Spiritism brings us knowledge of himself as a key to the elevation of
morality of the soul. For this we will have to deny all our defects of such
way that we depure our spirit through intimate reform. But beyond the soul
we also need to take care of the body, since both are intimately
Connected. in this article we will address the spiritual consequences of vices in
General.

Usually the vices of humanity are completely material. Things like
sex, drugs, food, luxury, consumerism, etc., become more intense and increasingly
more present in people's daily lives. Such vices come from our
imperfect nature that still targets the material before the spiritual.

Therefore, we become increasingly dependent on what we like. "For
wherever your treasure is, then your heart will be too." ( Matthew 6:21),
such words are God's first warning through his messengers to
us on the importance of knowing: What do I love?

If the answer to this question is a material thing it is quite likely that still
the matter is too connected. This fact is exemplified in the daily lives of
Incarnate. usually loves possessions and people are possessed.

The problem of this assertion in relation to the material goods and pleasures of
meat is that the pleasures of meat are transient and so deserve a place
than we usually attribute them. Then we have the problem regarding
the devaluation of the spiritual in relation to the material.

## Harmful vices to the body 
In order to maintain the carnal body it is necessary to feed us, socialize,
laugh, take care of your health. However, when too much energy is applied for such
factors, we end up becoming addicted to the pleasures that these acts in the
Provide.

God put pleasure in sex, food and activities of our taste so that
we could seek them in order to perpetuate the species, to conserve our
body system and to socialize. Note that they are all processes of
laws of God, the law of society, reproductive law, conservation law, etc.

    703. With what goal Has God given to all living beings the instinct of his
    Conservation?

    "Everyone must compete for the designs of Providence; that's why
    God gave them the need to live. And, moreover, life is necessary for
    improvement of beings; they feel it instinctively without it if
    realize."

    711. Is the use of the earth's property a right of all men?

    "This right is a consequence of the need to live. God could not have
    tax a duty, without having given the means of complying with it."


    712. To what purpose has God put an attraction in the enjoyments of
    material goods?
    "To incite man to fulfill his mission and also to
    experience it, through temptation."
    a) What is the purpose of this temptation?
    "Develop your reason, which must preserve it from excesses."


    If man were only instigated to the use of the earth's assets, in view of the
    usefulness, its indifference could perhaps compromise the harmony of the
    Universe: God gave him the attraction of pleasure, which impels him to fulfillment
    of the designs of Providence. But through that very attraction, God wanted,
    furthermore, try it, through temptation, which drags you into the
    abuse, that his reason should defend him.

    ( The Spirits Book, Part 2, Cap. V)

The material pleasure felt in these activities as we have seen well is due to the fact that the
the need for man to seek them for his conservation in life. The
problem is that, by selfishness and moral weakness, man gives himself to
superfluous and unnecessary vices. A good example is cigarette, a glass created
human pride, as well as drugs in general, which aim to seek
transient sensations that spiritually cause enormous problems.

As we studied earlier, the perispirit is linked to the physical body and
"prints" in this, all our attitudes of physical and spiritual consequence.
If we drink and hit our physical liver, similar area in our
perispirit will suffer an injury if we smoke and make our lungs not
healthy, we will feel when disembodiment the symptoms of shortness of breath and pain in the area
that the lungs would be left. All these attitudes that hurt our
perispirit will be felt by the spirit as they pass into the spirit world.

Exaggerations in feeding, as well as exaggerations with the search for the perfect body,
making us hostages of this also cause some negative impressions on the
Perispirit. Anabolicsteroids for example, deform and create evil inflammations
for the organism and this is reflected in the spirit. According to André Luiz, in our
certain behaviors created a kind of black glomeruli, which attacked
the physical apparatus of the spirit through the perispirit. These glomeruli were
directly linked to the nervous system, in such a way that the thoughts of the
creature by surrendering to those carnal pleasures was what created them.

Out drugs, which has a more violent and rapid effect both in the body
material as in the perispirit. Such consequences can cause animalisation
of the spirit due to the myasmes acquired by thoughts and companies
that the use of hallucinogens and vices created.

    713. Do the enjoyments have limits drawn by nature?
    "Yes, to indicate to you the limit of what is necessary; however, by your
    excesses, come to satiety and punish yourselves."

    714. What to think of the man you are looking for, in the excesses of all genders,
    a refinement for your enjoyments?
    "Poor thing! We pity him and we do not envy him, for he is very close
    of death!"

    a) Is it from physical death or moral death that he is near?
    "Of both."

    The man who seeks, in the excesses of all genres, a refinement of
    joys falls below the animal, for it knows how to stop, when satisfied the
    your need. Give up the reason God gave you as a guide and how much
    greater are his excesses, greater preponderance he gives to his nature
    animal about its spiritual nature. Diseases, diseases,
    death, which are a consequence of abuse, are at the same time the
    punishment to the transgression of God's law.

    716. Nature, through our organization, did not set the limit of
    our needs?

    "Yes, but man is insatiable. Nature has set the limit of its
    needs through their organization; vices, however, altered their
    constitution and have created for him needs that are not real."

## Vampirism and the obsession of vices
Misuse of natural resources or even drugs that are not necessary or
can cause what we call vampirism. Vampirism is the act of
disembodied spirit, who was once addicted to some less healthy habit than
has become an addiction, sucking the energies arising from the consumption of this or that act
Vicious. Spirits who in life were alcoholics by the law of attraction are
taken to bars by the vibration itself. From there they begin to connect with the
incarnated from the environment, seeking to steal from them the fluids of the activities
Vicious.

Through our attitudes we will attract a specific type of companions
Spiritual. Promiscuous will attract spirits of this strain, the smoker will attract
spirits linked to tobacco addiction and so on. Such spirits
make them so dependent on the red to maintain their vices that they themselves
influence the red to "go there and have a little" or to commit acts
that have extracted the necessary and healthy habitation. Such misfit habits
can create a situation of obsession difficult to change.

## How to avoid vices 
It seems unnecessary, but most of us have some kind of addiction
harmful health to a greater or lesser extent, so we should keep in mind that
we need to know each other so that we have no known our defects and our
Difficulties. Noticed this, we must work them, which means: fight against
negative drags.

If we know what our difficulties are, we will have the most possibilities of
understand them and with this we apply all our energy and will so that
we have healthier habits that are compatible with evolving spirits that
Are.

It is always good to remember also that there are phones and entities that help in the
combating smoking, drugs and alcoholism. we'll leave at the end some
Them. Other than that everyone can and should seek help in spiritist houses to
treatments of healing passes concomitantly with the search for professionals
that can help in the fight against our material weaknesses. That
jesus can help us today and always! A lot of peace for everyone!
