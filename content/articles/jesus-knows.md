How many tears have you shed alone, with no one to extend you a shoulder
friend, without a word of encouragement, without any consolation...

Consider, however, that Jesus knows...

When you discover that your friends, in whom you deposited the most sincere
trust, betray him, and bitterness visits him to the sore soul, in the silence of the
Hours... Jesus knows.

Jesus knows the most secret thoughts and feelings of each of the
sheep that the Father entrusted to Him.

Jesus knows about the sleepy nights when you struggle in search of solutions
for the problems that concern his mind...

Of the pains that have torn his soul, when loneliness seems to be his only
faithful companion, Jesus knows...

Of the immense obstacles you've overcome, without any star per witness,
Jesus knows...

From his thirst for justice, Jesus knows.

From his struggle to be better every day than the day before, Jesus knows.

Jesus, This Big Brother, whom the Father entrusted earthly humanity, knows
each of His guardians.

If you have suffered some kind of slander, of injustice, some undeserved punishment,
Jesus knows.

Jesus knows his waking hours next to a family member's bed
Sick...

You know about your dedication to children, so often ungrateful, to the husband or to the wife
Problem.

Jesus knows his self-confrontations to overcome his own vices and
unfortunate tendencies.

Jesus knows his weaknesses, his fears, his open wounds, his
Insecurities...

Jesus knows the many times you persist in walking, even with your feet
Bleeding...

Jesus knows the weight of the cross you carry on your shoulders...

Jesus knows how many drops of tears you have shed compassion, suffering the
pain of other hearts...

Jesus knows his many renunciations...

Your unconfessed bitterness...

Jesus knows the hopes you have already distributed, of the encouragementyou offered,
of the hours he voluntarily dedicated to the benefit of someone...

Jesus knows his noble actions and realizes the disdain of those who only notice and
highlight their flaws.

Jesus understands his sore heart of longing, torn apart by loneliness,
bitter by the difficulties that sometimes seem insurmountable...

Jesus knows that all the situations you go through are for your
learning and for its growth towards great light.

The Sublime Shepherd knows each of His sheep and knows what's going on with
each of them.

That's why He himself assured him, "You'll never be alone.

Jesus is the Divine Friend who follows us in the footsteps forever and forever.

And in times when your forces want to abandon him, snuggle up to the
His loving heart and hear His voice telling him, with immense tenderness:

My son, trace your groove; start again the next day the labor aphanoso of the
Eve.

The work of your hands provides you with earthly bread; his soul, however,
it's not forgotten.

And I, the divine gardener, cultivation in the silence of his thoughts.

While sounding the time of the home and the plot of life if it escapes his hands and his
eyes close to the light, will feel that it arises in you, and germinates, my
precious seed.

Nothing is lost in the kingdom of our Father and his sweats and miseries form the
treasure that will make him rich in the upper spheres, where light replaces the
Darkness...

And where the most bare among you will perhaps be the most resplendent.
