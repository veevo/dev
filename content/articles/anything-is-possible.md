Are you an optimistic person? He believes that everything can be solved with
effort, calm and perseverance?

Or do you already discredit many things? You think there are many
situations you're not going to fight against?

The Apostle Mark recorded in his Gospel that anything is possible to what
Believe. Is that right?

It narrates an ancient legend that, in the Middle Ages, there was an extremely
Religious. Because it happened that a barbaric crime shook the city. A woman out
brutally murdered.

The author was an influential person of the kingdom. That's why, soon if
tried to look for someone who could be blamed.

The religious man was chosen and brought to trial. When he was arrested,
he sensed he could not save himself. Your fate would be the gallows. All
conspired against him.

I knew you wanted to blame him. The judge himself was all right
to simulate a judgment and condemn it.

He decided to pray, begging for help and inspiration to face the
interrogation and do well.

At one point, the judge proposed to him the following: Because he is a man of
deep religiosity, I will let the Lord God decide his destiny.

I'll write on one piece of paper the word "guilty" and in another the
word "innocent". You'll draw one of the papers. What you choose, will be the
your verdict. God will decide your luck.

The poor man sweated cold. Immediately he realized that a trap to him
was being prepared. Of course, the judge, who wished to convict him,
i would prepare both roles with the same and only word: guilty.

How could he save himself? There was no alternative. No way out.

The judge finally put both papers on the table and sent the
accused choose one of them. A huge silence was made in the room.

You could hear the defendant's accelerated breath. All heads
gifts turned to him, waiting for his choice. Your decision.

The man thought a few seconds. Then he approached the table confidently,
reached out and took one of the papers. He quickly put it in his mouth and the
Swallowed.

Those present at the trial reacted indignantly at his attitude.

How do You know now what your verdict is?

Simple, he answered. Just look at the other piece of paper. What
left on the table. Of course, the one I swallowed is the other way around.

Immediately, the man was released.

                                   *   *   *

Hope always calms despair and skirts difficulty. Your
voice never stops singing. His blessed music luariza the night of suffering,
calming the misfortune.

No one can move forward, in the rude ways of life, without their
Presence.

No one can spare her.

Wherever it appears, hope alters the landscape, inspiring
courage, all embellishing with color, perfume and beauty.
