Some think that the Creator sometimes sentences His creatures to suffering
Eternal.

However, as far as one can see, Heavenly Father manifests himself through
laws that express being His goal the supreme good.

These laws can be observed even in the rudimentary processes of the field
Physical.

Fire is a precious agent of evolution, at the limits at which it must be conserved.

However, if we put our hands on the brazier, it is natural that we will suffer
painful consequences.

The machine is ancillary part of progress.

But in hands that do not know how to handle it, it can become an instrument of
Destruction.

Negligence, malpractice or indiscipline in its use cause results
Disastrous.

The same occurs in the planes of consciousness.

In the mathematics of the Universe, fate always gives the creature what it gives you
The.

It is pointless that authorities of one or another religious principle paint the Whole
Powerful with the paints of human passions.

We often hear interpretations that resemble God to a sovereign
surrounded by purple and riches.

To someone who simply rules His subjects from a distance.

According to these accounts, He is angry by a lack of praise or by the
disobedience of His children.

It also besits with adulnations.

Those who present the Divinity may be moved from holy purposes.

Perhaps they reason under the influx of respectable legends and traditions of the past
Distant.

But they forget that even before the laws of men, any person
can morally steal the meritory or guilt of another.

God is love.

Love that expands from atom to stars.

But it's justice too.

Justice he attributes to each Spirit according to what he himself chose.

Our Master Jesus said that each one would be given according to his works.

Being love, God grants the misplaced conscience as many experiences as
need in order to rectify the path itself.

Being justice, you ignore privileges of any order. For Him, everyone is
the same, children of His love.

Let us never say, therefore, that God privileges one and condemns to others.

Let's just remember we can't reason for someone else's brains.

We can't feed through the mouth of the next one either. Each is responsible for
for their own actions.

God created us all so that we may be great, so that we may carry out the
progress, intellectual order and moral order.

In a word, so that we can reach happiness in the broadest sense.

For this, being love, it provides us with a path of blessings and lights.

Being justice, he determined that each Spirit possess ed will and reason.

So none of us are a victim but yourself.

Each one that advances or is late, as we wish, in the course of
countless existences.

Free will is widely in the Universe.

It is only necessary to bear the consequences of the options themselves.

In this way, our life, here or in the Beyond, will always be whatever we want, that is,
whatever we do.

Let's think about it.
