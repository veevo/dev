A few days ago I moved into my new home.

The furniture had arrived and needed to be assembled. I therefore hired the
services of a joiner.

He was an experienced, hard-working man. In just three days managed to assemble
single-handed bedroom furniture, living room and kitchen.

And I'd really like to talk too. Between one hammered and another, a screw
adjusted, pulled the most diverse subjects.

Every once in a while, i was talking politics. At other times, he discussed the
advantages of your favorite football team. Still, he talked about time,
and the latest sensationalist news from the newspapers.

But undoubtedly his favorite subject was his family. I'd like to tell you about
the dedication of his wife and the intelligence and education of his children. Your
eyes shone with pride and happiness.

However, on that third day, upon arriving at my home to complete the
assembly of the furniture, I realized that there was something different in your countenance.

He worked all day practically in silence and, because I worried about such
change of behavior, I questioned him about what was going on.

That had not been an easy day for him: in the morning, his work vehicle
had presented problems and therefore would stay several days in the workshop
Mechanical.

When I was at the bus stop, waiting for the transport that would bring you to my
house, a burglar stole his toolbox.

And as if that wasn't enough, your wallet was in the box. In this way, all
his documents had been misplaced as well.

Therefore, he was extremely angry, which justified his silence.

When he finished his work, in solidarity with the sad events
of that day, I offered him a ride home, for I knew he was very
Tired. Thank you, he said yes.

Upon arriving, he invited me in, so that I would know his
Family.

In front of the residence, there was a majestic tree. Before opening the
his house, the worker leaned back on her for brief moments and, after that,
his countenance changed, which caused me great astonishment.

He came into the house smiling, kissing his wife and children, and, for a change, speaking
Very much.

She invited me to dinner and the evening was very nice.

As I said goodbye, surrounded by curiosity, I questioned him about the tree and that
radical change of attitude.

Smiling, he answered me, That's my trouble tree. When I get to
my house, I leave all my problems in it, so that does not discount them
in my family, for they are of no nothing fault.

Tomorrow, when I go to work, I catch them again and, with God's help, I leave
to solve them.

Although the difficult situations that present themselves on a daily basis, we have always cultivated
the good cheer with those around us.

Let's not let our problems turn into rude words,
impatience, lack of affection, love, understanding, tenderness.

Because the money, the stress, the goals to be achieved are gone... But the
family, friends, moments of complicity alongside those who love us and
who we love, these yes are eternal...

Let's think about it. But let's think about it now!
