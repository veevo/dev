You've had the feeling that you didn't close the door, you didn't turn off the iron.
electric, you didn't brake the car, didn't you turn off the light?

These situations arise, questioning what, a few minutes ago, we had as
a certainty.

If we allow ourselves to be tormented by such ideas, they become part of the
our daily lives, transforming into neuroses that, on a larger scale, cause us
Losses. It is the so-called fixed idea, mental fixation or monoidea.

In this same line of reasoning, feelings of jealousy, envy, the
political, religious and sporting fanaticism, considered the degrees of
intensity, can cause damage to our spiritual economy.

Caused by these fixed ideas, anxieties arise, fears,
insecurities, the sorrows stored, among other evils.

When we wrap these feelings in our intimacy, so that we
allow them to torment, to the point that they constitute a fixed idea or
monoidea, we can generate imbalances and disturbances of difficult removal.

If we realize the insinuations of these negative ideas trying to install in
our minds, we make efforts to expel them immediately.

We employ the firm will, initiative, perseverance in good purposes,
faith and patience as true antidotes to expel these ideas
Pernicious.

Moral transformation, action in good, noble ideals of feeling, art,
of culture, are efficient measures in the prevention of undesirable ideas.

If sometimes we find ourselves entangled in the webs of circumstances
disturbing, let us analyze the thoughts we feed, for in them
are the cause of these imbalances.

Therefore, keeping the mind and hands occupied in noble work are measured
prophylactic, which strengthen us spiritually, predisposing us to the liberation of
definite of these true mental prisons.

Let us seek to air our minds with optimism, with uplifting readings, with faith
in God, allowing us to be happy as much as one can be happy about the
Earth.

Jesus asserted that wherever our treasure is, there will be our hearts.

May hope be our great treasure and may our hearts be
always balsamized by its lights, illuminating our souls and helping us to
to free us definitively from the mental prisons that congratulate us so much.

                                   *   *   *

At times when we allow ourselves misfits mental fixations, Spirits
unhappy may suggest us evil ideas, increasing our imbalance.

In these situations, we can incite our pride, the thirst for revenge, jealousy,
phobias, among other evils.

It was no other reason why Jesus recommended vigilance and prayer.

Vigilance over the thoughts we issue so that we can
control them, not allowing us to fall into the unfortunate suggestions of Spirits
Tormented.

And prayer, in the search for noble inspirations from above.
