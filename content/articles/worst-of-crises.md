James, one of jesus' Apostles, was quite faithful to the traditions of the time, at the
the laws and sacred books of his people.

He used to reflect on the depth of Jesus' teachings, and on the
great opportunity that was to live with Him.

He once questioned the Master, concerned about the successive political crises and
that the local people experienced, because of the overwhelming dominance of Rome.

I wonder why they lived between successive economic crises, and if a crisis
worse was yet to happen.

Jesus, in His infinite calm, kindness, and wisdom replied: The worst crisis,
James, it is the moral character of man, who ends up causing all the others.

He explained that the human being still settles in ignorance, linked to passions that
dominate him and congratulate him.

He stressed that, at the root of the moral crisis, selfishness is found, which will always act
harming others.

In the absence of solidarity and fraternity, ambition, madness,
and the disasters arising from these moral vices.

People isolate themselves in their pride, in the illusion of power, race, faith
religious or political, contributing to the disharmony among creatures.

The unmeasured ambition for material possessions causes profound imbalances, with
some possessing a lot, and so many possessing almost nothing.

Unbridled consumption can lead individuals and even one nation to ruin.

In his conversation with James, the Master says that the severe crisis of those days was the
since the beginning of time, and which would still last for a long period of
period in terrestrial society.

Jesus ends by saying: In the future, existential, political and moral crises
will yield place to understanding, based on love, because then the most severe
human crises will be resolved: the moral crisis.

The considerations made by Jesus more than two thousand years ago are of a
impressive timeliness.

Today, moral crises, such as crimes and corruption, take enormous time in
news and big headlines in newspapers.

Political crises, in the form of wars, are repeated, based on the illusion of
possession, pride and power.

Economic crises, based on political disregard, on the greed of those who
command the financial system, and in the individual obsession of collecting assets if
repeated, causing large imbalances.

However, we know, listening to our dear friend and guide, that real change
begins in each of us, and that the world walks, even if in slow steps to the
our eyes, for a real change.

A new world will only be possible if it is based on love, with acts worth more
than words, with understanding and brotherhood.

In the future, crisis will be a word restricted to the dictionary. But for that
a long and silent battle must be fought in the depths of being
in search of balance and love!
