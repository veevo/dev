How far can love go? The question is asked every time some tragedies
shake public opinion.

Tragedies such as suicides, murders and persecution of creatures that even a
moment before they claimed to love each other deeply.

In this scenario, human lives are sacrificed. Young people, with a promising future
ahead, given the possibility of losing their beloved, they opt for suicide.

And as a form of revenge, they make a point of leaving a note
incriminating, when they do not decide to ruin their own lives in front of whom
claim to be the object of their love.

Creatures that lived together a few years, who have raised children, suddenly face
to a betrayal, an abandonment, opt for the death of their own and of the children.

Children who are most often very small and to whom they are not asked
if they wish to die. Or serve as an instrument of revenge against each other.

In the face of such facts, we wonder if it will truly love the feeling that
unites creatures that destroy each other, and take with them other beings,
children of their own flesh?

Is love this feeling you prefer to destroy to resign?

Love is of divine essence, affirm the noble Spirits. Now, if it's divine,
can only create beautiful things, scenarios of tranquility and peace.

Those who love do not harm the being loved under any circumstances. Unloved, proceeds
loving, since the fullness of love is his own exercise.

Love is characterized by feelings of generosity, altruism, of
Detachment.

Those who love always desire the good of the other, regardless of the circumstances.

We must conclude that as long as we are assaulting each other, the feeling may
have many nuances, but you can't call love.

In this context, it is equally salutary to remember that no one owns anyone.

Those who must constitute homes, we have already set the targets before reincarnation,
in the Spirit World. Always serving the purposes of elevation and progress.

Let us remember that our children are not our property. They come through us,
but they don't belong to us.

We provide them with bodies to develop on Earth. However, the soul belongs
to the Father of all of us.

Coming through us, they also bring their missions and evidence to
Fulfill. And we have no right to create obstacles to them.

If we are suffering situations where love seems to have become ill,
let us allow ourselves to reflect, meditation.

If someone who lives next to us wishes to leave, we do not attack him, in the name of the
our love.

If someone harms us or attacks us, we do not review us, remembering that always what
thus acts, is sick.

As a sick, it does not require our sentence of death or fierce persecution,
but of a doctor of the body and soul.

If we love, we donate our share of love, praying for our loves, wherever they are,
with whom they are, how they are.

                                   *   *   *

Love all works out.

If, by chance, the sky of your smiles is with the stars of joy
erased, loves, anyway.

In this way, you will illuminate other hearts that are in darkness more
dark, because everyone you love radiates light and heat. Remains happy in
any circumstances.
