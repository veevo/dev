Every day, we come across the most diverse news of what happens in the
World.

Because we are all connected, linked to social networks, to the news that
take assault the screens of our portable devices in real time, we know
much of what happens, all the time.

However, many of this information has a harmful character.

News of crimes, exotic behaviors are multiplied,
imbalances in various ways.

Corruption everywhere, corruption everywhere, is the case, in the list of information that is coming to us,
deaths trivialized by repetition, the crimes that diversify.

And then we have the feeling that nothing, nor anyone can stop this march
uncontrollable ness of a society that is unstructured.

As a reflection of this avalanche of bad news that comes to us, which fill us with the
eyes and ears, we get used to these landscapes.

At first we were shocked. Then it was a brief indignation. Over time, for
make common, began to receive a look of almost normality on our part.

Let's convince ourselves that everything is normal, that life is like this, that people
are so.

However, no violence is normal, no crime can be seen lightly,
no disrespect to our neighbor should gain citizenship.

This sense of false normality that invades us, subtly stealing from
we what we have most precious: our ability to outraged ourselves at
the mistake, of clashing against what is not of our nature.

And gradually, without realizing it, we lose our humanity, our
sensitivity, our solidarity, our empathy with others.

It is necessary to reflect.

Those who act badly and who make headlines, becoming the news of the day, are
Exception. Far away are the rule.

The vast majority of us are good people, who want to act properly,
fulfill our duties, raise our children, pay our bills, be at peace.

So let us not let ourselves be convinced that humanity is lost.

If we believe that, with every look of indifference we cast about the
misery of one' self,we will gradually be losing our own humanity.

So we lost a little of our humanity to every cruel judgment that
we face each other's mistake.

It is upon us our humanity when we judge everyone as
potentially dishonest, corrupt, criminal.

If some allow themselves to be driven by their weaknesses and enrich illegally,
are thousands who honor their jobs and wages by working worthily.

If some decide to walk through the path of crime and violence, there are thousands of
those who live peacefully, distributing kindness and pacification in the middle where
Live.

So we cultivated our humanity.

It will be through it that we will share what we bring best in our souls.

And the more we strengthen our humanity, the more we will recognize ourselves in our
Next.

From this, it will be easier to follow Jesus' counsel, to love the next
like ourselves.
