All religious schools bring in their teachings deep relationships with the understanding of life after life.

It is natural that this is so because it is religions, in their various shades, the compass and protection for things that transcend the explanations of science and reason.

Thus, of course, we desire the achievement of happiness after the conclusion of this life, according to this or that precept.

If Paradise or Nirvana, or whatever denomination we give it, is the destiny of those who conduct themselves well here, we seek references on how to act and proceed so that happiness is the ultimate destination.

In this eagerness and concern for future happiness, we imagine that it will be built by external actions, ritualism or appearance.

We forget that nothing that is done outwardly will make sense unless it comes from our intimacy.

The meaning and value of external actions are directly linked to the feeling with which we impregnate them.

Thus, prayers, rites, promises and covenants are worth nothing if they are not born in the intimacy of our soul.

Thus, it can be understood that the kingdom of heaven, that paradise and future happiness are the intimate construction of each creature and will inevitably be externalized in the afterlife.

If we are concerned to be happy beyond that, let us begin today to implement this happiness in the matrices of our soul.

To achieve this, the conquest of a clear conscience, the result of the rightly fulfilled duty, the well-conducted commitments, the rightly delineated objectives, is certainly the best reference.

Seeking internal righteousness, based on noble values ​​that we all bring latent in the soul, we build the paradise we long for.

Thus we break the illusion that the kingdom of heaven, poetically illustrated and exemplified by Jesus, is a physical place or a destination to come.

In no way will we come externally to happiness because it is an intimate construction.

So we do not plan to reach Heaven, Paradise or Nirvana.

Let us begin today the construction of this much desired happiness.

And when we have it in our intimacy, wherever we meet, there will be our blessed heaven, the conquest of the soul toward the things of God.

* * *

The Spirit is doomed to happiness.

Everyone is on earth to gain happiness, journeying toward the fullness that is the future goal.

A life rich in inner beauty is a poem of joy.

In silence the flowers bloom, the embryo develops, the landscape changes, the stars sparkle for joy.

In the silence of the soul we develop superior qualities and blossom into happiness.
