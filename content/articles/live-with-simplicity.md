A simple life with simple pleasures. Does it look attractive? For some, poetry
of simple life is an aspiration.

Not many, but increases every day those who seek a more lifestyle
Stripped.

While the large mass is adept at the benefits offered by
cities, gradually man is increasingly tired of urban routine,
enlouquecedora.

Pollution, traffic jams, noises. The forest of buildings to be lost in the
horizon, hiding sky and sun.

All this contributes to the stresses and anguish of contemporary man.

As a young man, it is natural for people to desire the challenges and facilities of
cities, which offer objects of desire at every corner.

They are the wonders of technology, the fashion bars, the designer clothes, the beautiful
offices, careers.

All this exerts tremendous fascination. But gradually, it is possible to observe that
this model is emptying. A certain tiredness begins to be noticed.

An expression has been gaining space: quality of life. They are increasingly
those who wish to return to the ideals of a simple life, a house in the
field, a closer contact with nature.

They want to breathe fresh air, watch a golden sunset, spend nights of
tranquility in a lazy network, keep late afternoon conversations.

The feeling that one has is that humanity, after all, begins to realize that life
it's much more than passenger pleasures.

The reasons for the exhaustion of the urban way of life are consumerism
rampant and the feeling of being in a permanent race.

At work, the challenge is competitiveness, which runs over the human being and the
consumes it, turning it into a piece of a cold gear.

It is a perverse process, which sucks energy, stimulates jealousy and transforms into
enemies who should work in harmony.

And a question is usually asked by those who are in this living wheel: you can live
with simplicity in the big cities?

It is possible to reconcile the demands of a career, social life and the family
with a more mild routine?

The answer is... Yes! You can reconcile all this. It's not a task too easy,
but can be accomplished.

That's because simplicity is not made of exterior demonstrations. She's a
state of mind.

We don't have to dress in rags or give up a normal life to be
simple people.

Simplicity is in living life without misplaced demands. Who chooses the
simplicity, uncomplicates everyday life.

We often get lost in completely unnecessary detail. And with
this, we make our lives and that of others unbearable.

Notice carefully and you will notice: we make too many demands because of
minimal things, which we don't even remember after a while.

Therefore, the option of living with simplicity is, first of all, a way of
thank God for what we have received.

Simplicity is having dreams. But if they don't realize themselves for some reason,
yet life does not lose grace. That is, despite the storms, the
contentment remains unwavering.

You want to be happy? Be simple. Experience the pleasure of the things that are at your
Around!

Look at the sky, see the gold-dyed clouds in the blue infinity.

Listen to the sound of spontaneous laughs, feel the freshness of a glass of water, the taste
of a fruit, the serenity of a well-slept night.

See the beauty of books and songs. Who says there's no pleasure in things
little ones God has put within our reach?
