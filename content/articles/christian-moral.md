When it comes to Christian morals, it's possible that someone claims to be her so old
and that, even so, has produced nothing efficient in the reform of customs.

Now, how can old what wasn't used?

Christian morality is, in its purity and in essence, unknown to humanity.

His performance has not yet been felt in depth and ostentatiously.

However, the understanding of Christ's morals depends on our happiness under
every aspect.

There are few who question how it is possible to have the Son of God come to the
World and have not illuminated all the mistakes of science and taken from men
all ignorance.

The answer lies in the fact that Jesus came to bring to Humanity another proposal: the
to teach us to be good, illuminating one's own intimacy and conquering
with one's own efforts, desired happiness.

It is for this reason that Jesus did not teach philosophers the composition of
continents, neither geometras the square of the circle nor to the navigators to
north or south direction, nor to the chemicals the discovery of the stone
philosopher's, neither to physicians the virtues of herbs and plants, nor to astrologers
and astronomers the course, the greatness, the number and influences of the stars.

He just taught us to be humble.

He just taught us how to be chaste.

He just taught us to escape the avarice.

He just taught us to forgive the injuries.

He only taught us to be persecuted for the cause of justice.

It only taught us to eliminate vices and exercise virtues, because these are
rules and conclusions. These precepts and the theorems through which the
be good, to be fair.

This is the science that Jesus professed and came to teach us all.

And it's similar teaching that we need these days.

If we look at the aspects of the problem of our day, we will realize
that the crisis that terrorizes the world is the crisis of character, responsible for all
the others.

We will realize that the moment claims the action of honest, scrupulous men,
possessed from the spirit of justice and with the responsibility of their responsibilities.

We have lived under the despotism of intelligence. It is upon us to shake off the yoke and
proclaim the reign of character, the empire of consciousness, morals and
Feelings.

This is the great lesson left by the Son of God, to this day misunderstood.

Here is the key to solving all the problems of humanity: knowing and living
the teachings of Sublime Galileo which he said, with the safety of those who know what
says, no one will come to the Father but through Him.

The Christian is summoned to the ennobled ministry of building good throughout
by consolidating the relevant service possibilities, such as an initial step
for the preparation of better days.
