How's our tolerance?

Do we have a hard time accepting anyone who thinks differently from us?

We have difficulty supporting those who know less, or who seems to be less
Smart?

We need to talk about this virtue which is the minimum necessary for a
healthy coexistence, without so much friction and disagreements.

To tolerate is accepting what could be condemned, is to let do what one could
prevent or combat.

Therefore, it is to renounce a part of his power, of his strength, of his anger...
Thus, we tolerate the whims of a child or the positions of an opponent.

But that is only virtuous if we assume, as they say, if we overcome our own
interest, our own suffering, our own impatience.

Tolerance has to do with humility, or rather, it stems from it.

According to Voltaire: "We must tolerate each other, because we are all
inconsequential, mutability, error."

Humility and mercy go together, and this set, with regard to the
thought, leads to tolerance.

"Tolerating is, of course, not an ideal," Abauzit noted, "is not a maxim,
is a minimum."

If the word tolerance was imposed, however, it is undoubtedly because of love or
respect everyone feels very incapable in dealing with their
Opponents. Now, it is in relation to them, first, that tolerance acts...

"Waiting for the beautiful day when tolerance leans to love," concludes
Jankélévitch, we will say that tolerance, prosaic tolerance is what
better we can do!

To tolerate – no less exalting that this word is – is therefore a solution
passable; waiting for better, that is, waiting for men to be loved,
or simply get to know each other and understand each other, we demo us by happy with that they
begin to endure.

It is little virtue, but indispensable. It's just a start, but it is."

                                   *   *  *

Tolerance is a path of peace.

Let us not judge this or that ignorant or uninformed companion, for,
if we learn to listen, we already know how to understand.

In the face of creatures that address us any aggression, let us talk to
of naturalness, without words of review that they can disappoint the interlocutor. 

Before any offence, let us not lose our fraternal smile and articulate some
phrase, able to return the offender to tranquility.

In the obstacles of existence, we will tolerate the obstacles without rebellion and they
will easily make removable. 

In professional service, we patiently support the difficult colleague, and,
few, in observing calm and prudence, he himself will transform for
the provisions themselves. 

As a family, we will tolerate the less friendly relatives and, with our examples of
selflessness, we will conquer from all of them the blessing of sympathy. 

Let us work on this virtue from now on. Let's think about it.
