There are alarming news that comes daily on the high rates of
drug deaths, called lawful ones.

In Brazil alone, statistics show that about 80,000 people die
victimized by tobacco-related diseases. This is equivalent to
approximately ten deaths per hour.

Another drug that has claimed thousands of lives is alcohol.

In the face of all this we wonder what can be done to stop or, by the
less, to diminish this tragic reality.

However, before initiating any campaign to eradicate these evils,
we need to locate their springs.

And for that, we need to turn our gaze into our homes.

It's from inside a home we all left. And it is within the home that we receive the
first lessons, life or death.

As long as parents are not aware that they are most often
responsible for the unhappy habits of their children, there will be no campaign that
be efficient.

As long as we parents do not stop blaming friends, in the bad
companies, in the tobacco and alcohol industries, we will not solve
the problem.

Research shows that most teens start on calls
licit drugs because they have the example within their own home, taken by the
curiosity and prove what parents prove and approve.

How many times do we not observe the small children joining the cigarette stump that a
of the parents throws it on the floor and take it to the mouth trying to imitate the adults?

Who to blame in this case?

To the child, who is a copycat par excellence, or to adults, who know what
Are you doing it?

Later, when the son already knows how to speak and the parents try to repress him, he
simply replies: If you do, why can't I?

In this situation, parents do not have moral authority to prevent their child from smoking
or drink, for they are living lessons from addictions.

However, there are parents who do not smoke or drink and their children, despite this,
in these drugs.

Maybe it's because they perceive the neighbor or colleagues who, in turn,
exemplify and arouse curiosity. In this case, parents may and should
efforts to clarify the children of the harms of such habits,
through friendly and fraternal dialogue.

Due to the alarming rates of doom that these lawful drugs have
provided to our hearts, it is worth meditating, sincerely,
on the campaign of effective eradication of these evils, and to start it from now on,
starting with ourselves.

                                   *   *   *

Your son is an incarnate Spirit and as such brings with him acquired habits
throughout stocks.

Happy habits or not, which you should perceive through conviviality and fight
by modifying the bad and strengthening the good. That's education.

We don't doubt it! The Divine Laws, which are written in our consciousness
ask, What have you done with your children entrusted to your guard?

Let us prepare to answer the best: We did everything that was to our
Reach.
