It is said that in the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific, the natives discovered a
entirely different way of tearing down trees.

If any trunk is too thick to be slaughtered with their axes, they the
they drop in the scream.

That's right, in the scream. Lumberjacks climb the tree every morning well and
they scream.

They repeat the ritual for thirty days. The tree dies and falls apart. Second
them, the method never fails and the explanation, also according to the natives, is that,
screaming, they kill the spirit of the tree.

Civilized people soon think that if they had modern technology,
could simply tear down the tree with powerful machines, quickly and
more efficiently.

However, the technique of these natives leads us to think about how we still
we use the cry in our lives.

We scream in traffic when an inattentive driver performs some maneuver
unfortunately, making it difficult for us to free movement.

We screamed at the football game, with the referee, the flag, the player, and even
with the ball that seems to deflect from the goal just to provoke us.

We speak loudly with the security of the bank because the revolving door prevents us from
Entry. We cursed the supermarket cashier because it's too slow, because it doesn't
package the goods, because it provides us with the wrong change.

We fight with appliances because they don't work properly.

At home, often, as we draw attention to what is wrong,
we forget to control the volume of the voice and talk too loudly with our
children, with his wife, with our brothers.

We almost always yell at the kids when they're doing some pesky.
However, the cry, besides not educating, scares.

We can imagine the disturbances caused in the fragile organism of the small, with
a big scare?

With co-workers, it is common to exaggerate in the tone of the voice just to say
that particular task should be redone.

In public places, such as restaurants, snack bars, when in groups, in the
we forget the respect we owe people, and allow ourselves to laugh,
speak too loudly. And we don't even realize how much our fuss disturbs
the ears of others.

All this makes us reflective. If the natives of the Solomon Islands have discovered that
the trees are sensitive to the screams, what to say of humans!

Let's think: with screams and laughter, we disturb environments and people. With
coarse words, dictated by our impatience, we can break hearts
who love us or create insecurities in young children, who come to fear us,
instead of respecting.

                                   *   *   *

In the personal treatment, speech plays an important role.

The magic of the voice is one of those who should not be forgotten by all who find themselves
involved in human relations, listening to the various hearts.

Therefore, let us use the word to build, build, with the aim of
make life shine.

Let us speak with value, talk with love, so that we may be happy and make the
too happy.

Let us not forget that kindness and respect in personal dealing so too
they mean charity.
