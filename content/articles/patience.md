Do you think you're a patient?

Don't be in a hurry to answer, but listen carefully to the story that we're going to
Count.

A man was experiencing serious financial difficulty.

For some time he was unemployed and, due to his age, was being very
difficult to get a job.

I haven't had a decent meal in days and the discouragement had taken over
his will, so he wandered the streets now without destiny.

In a given stretch of the way, he saw on the ground what appeared to be a note of
Money.

He ran toward the paper and saw that it was a valuable ballot.

It wasn't much, but before collecting it from the sidewalk, he looked everywhere,
to see if no one around complained about the lack of money.

No, there was no one looking like i missed something.

Man thought, "It's too good to be true!

Although the amount is not so expressive, it would already serve to ease the hunger
that day.

Almost on a supel, he added the note, unmassing it.

However, what a disappointment! The note was actually only half the ballot.

Angry, he tore the piece of paper into pieces, throwing them into a manhole.

He continued the walk, amolentado, squealing in thought.

However, a few feet ahead, to your surprise, you would find the same note.
It was the other half of the first!

                                   *   *   *

The great problems of impatience are the losses that the impatient suffers.

The first of these is obviously the loss of serenity.

Without serenity, we are unable to coldly assess the circumstances that
involve us, so that we can see the possible outputs and solutions.

Losing serenity, we also lose common sense.

Without common sense, we become powerless, or just feel powerless.

Patience is respect.

Respect for others and ourselves.

Be patient, you too.

You will see that it is much more productive to work patiently than in
annoy with what will not be modified overnight.

Moreover, those who can't wait, can't enjoy it either!

                                   *   *   *

Tomas Edison, the great inventor, was already on the attempt number six hundred and
seven to glow a filament and be able to invent the lamp.

His tired assistant insisted he give up.

Edison persevered. Result: This time, the invention has achieved success.

You just realized what patience can achieve.

The patient person is the one who waits for the right time to act, the ideal time
to speak and the opportune moment to shut up.

Patience does not mean passivity, indolence or subservience.

Patience is the intelligent attitude of those who understand that people do not always
are as others would wish they would be.
