They then introduced Jesus to some little children so that he might touch them. And
as his disciples repelled with rude words those who presented them,
Jesus seeing this rebuked them and said to them:

"Let the little children come unto me, do not stop them; for the kingdom of heaven is for
those who resemble them.

I tell you, in truth, that whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as
a child, he will not enter into him."

And having embraced them, he blessed them by laying their hands on them.

                                   *   *   *

the passage narrated by Mark in his Gospel is of profound beauty, and
presents one of the highlights of Christ's lesson.

Why does Jesus promise the kingdom of heaven to those who resemble
Children?

He did not identify, there, in those childish bodies, reincarnated spirits,
returning to the earth stage with his challenges, his ills, his struggles, so
like any other being?

Obviously i do. So, what did Jesus mean by that?

The Master educator spoke of being a child himself, of the period of childhood, of this
when we are all candid, humble and moldable.

He spoke of the purity of the little ones, who have not yet had time to submit
vices, which have not yet learned malice or the exaggerated complexity of the
adult behavior.

Simplicity. The child's life is simple, and Jesus was there extolling the
simplicity in life as a propellant spring to launch us into this intimate state
of happiness, of kingdom of heaven in the heart.

The child settles for so little... It values the little things, has no
vanity, is not covert or prejudiced.

Resembling children is also seeing the world with joy, with
dazzle, no caveats, no sorrows...

It's being lighter. Yes, children weigh much less than adults.

It is to be lighter in attitudes, worries, excessive attachment to things.

The idea of a child of Jesus is the opposite of the idea of the old man, not in the sense of
elderly, but of those who do not modify their opinions, which does not alter their
behavior, which gives in for nothing in this world.

Old man is the one who let himself be bitter along the way. Child is the one who breathes joy and
gives new chances to yourself and others every day.

                                   *   *   *

My tired sight... My sad spark...

Harvested by sidewalk, ray of sunshine that persists

I miss the child I once went to,

Desire, eagerness, of a river that no longer flows.

Will there be a way back?

Is it possible to be a boy and wake up again?

I open the door of the future and find my son's beautiful face.

God made him look like me so he never forgot my eternal boy.

I want to be a boy with you, my son! Boy wanting to learn, who wants to
listen, that you want to be dazzled every day.

I want to be a boy with you and travel the earth once again, like it's the
first, because children always watch what they like several times, with the
joy and emotion of the first time.
