Personal defense

It is common, at present, in the face of the increase in the reigning violence, that creatures
consider carrying weapons or having them at home for eventuality.

You don't realize such people of the safety of the fact. More than that, when
someone comes to carry a gun, is conditioning itself, predisposing to use it.
And it never showed violence that he had snamised violence.

Guns at home have so far brought greater sum of pain and inconvenience.

There are numerous cases of children who, curious, trigger their parents' weapons or
brothers, injuring or injuring others. Sometimes mortally.

There are also cases of parents who triggered triggers against their own
children, returning home late at night, thinking it is about
Robbers.

In addressing the issue, Allan Kardec received from the Spirits the answer that only the
need can excuse the murder.

If we can, they say, preserve our lives without paying attention to that of the aggressor, it is
what we should do.

Now, when someone feeds the idea of hurting others, if assaulted, descends to the
criminal level. In addition, by tuning in with tracks of aggression, it begins to
be very easy target of aggressors of all sorts.

The fans of the hit, led say they act aggressively because already
they were waiting for each other's aggression.

They explain that they prefer to take the first blow before the other does.

What happens is that violence always generates a greater burden of violence.

The others are going to get along because we'd also assault if ours were the chance. Hurt
because we'd do the same if we had the chance.

It's important that we're not the rapist, the evil agent.

Divaldo Franco tells us a personal experience. The assailant puts you in a
knife to the neck, in the middle of the street, and tries to assault him.

Before the calm that seeks to appear, explaining nothing to have to give, nor the clock,
who had forgotten on the table, at home, the criminal gives in and is convinced to go to the
apartment where Divaldo was staying. With tight legs, given the fright that
hopefully, Divaldo is supported by the almost assailant.

A long chat, a café, a phone call that triggers spiritist companions, a
confrere who offers to employ the boy in despair and behold a friend
Conquered. One less bandit on the streets.

The best technique, therefore, of personal defense is trust in God, life
noble, intimate disarmament.

To fight back badly for evil is to become the same as bad.

Disarming yourself inwardly - here's a big decision. After all, we live forewarned
against each other, always with the word ferina and the gesture of vevide.

  Gandhi and Jesus were great advocates of non-violence, in a
world of violent men in which they lived.

They let themselves be immolar in the name of this ideal.

                                   *   *   *

Don't forget that the aggressor is distraught and a violent reaction, on the part
of the victim, will only aggravate the situation, which could end in tragedy.

The tranquility of the assaulted instills peace in the violent, who disarms himself from hatred and
realizes his hostility without justification.
