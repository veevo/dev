Selfishness is the source of the absolute majority of evils that plague humanity.

The exaggerated concern for their own interests causes anything
that the contrary takes unmeasure importance.

This misguided and creepy way of perceiving life harms everyone.

First, it takes away the peace of the selfish one himself, who is distressed in his attempts to
submit the world to their interests.

Second, it causes harm to society, which cannot be harmonic as long as its
members digladiam.

Solidarity and concern for collective well-being disseminate the
Happiness.

Take the issue of security as an example.

The inhabitants of large cities live on alert, afraid of being
Disturbed.

Who can hire surveillance service for their residence.

There is constant concern for children and relatives in general.

There are fears of a robbery, a lightning kidnapping, a blow of any order.

Such a situation is typical of a selfish society.

If concern for their own interests were less, they could be
found ways to solve the problem.

But for this, the purpose of creatures could not be to make the
any cost to own equity.

It is good and natural for men to worry about conquering goods that guarantee them
a dignified life, and foster progress.

But when the search for material things is exacerbated, it causes great
Problems.

In a society where the vast majority are carefree about the well-being
collective, disparities grow.

It is impossible for everyone to achieve exactly the same level of comfort.

Men are different in talents and abilities.

But it is necessary to ensure conditions for everyone to achieve the minimum
indispensable to a dignified living.

When man can see his neighbor as a similar one, he becomes supportive.

The pain of the other hurts as much as yours.

Misery and unemployment in the neighbor's house are as tragic as if they were in the
residence.

Imagine how good it would be to live in a safe society.

Get out quietly on the street, right at night.

Send your kids to school, certain no one would molest them.

It is in everyone's hands to adopt the initial steps for social reform.

This reform begins by the modification of one's own behavior.

Intimate reform is a tough battle.

It's easier to beat others than yourself.

But there are no misconceptions in the Universe, which is governed by Divine Wisdom.

Each one lives in the middle that is best suited to him.

If you wish to live in peace, start circumventing your interior.

Pay attention to all your attitudes that reveal selfishness.

This selfishness can be personal, familiar, or classy.

Review what you want for you, your family, or your class
Professional.

Is there any way to extend such advantages to others?

Isn't the cost of your perks overly high for the like?

It is certainly worth moderating a little the desires themselves, for the sake of a
harmonious life.

There's no point in getting rich causing the impoverishment of others.

It is not possible to live in peace amid the misery and pain of the like.

Genuine happiness arises when you learn to share.

Those who experience the chance of solidarity never go back.
