Knowing the difficulty in exercising forgiveness, Peter the Apostle,
question to Jesus how often such an exercise is needed, in relation to the
Next.

Jesus' answer invites us to a constant exercise, for the Master
proposes that forgiveness be exercised endlessly, represented in the expression
seventy times seven times.

What Jesus gives to understand with this expression is that good habits, as well as
are incorporated into our daily lives through insistence,
repetition, of continuous exercise.

Someone who can forgive four hundred and ninety times, as Jesus advises,
certainly, you will have already incorporated the habit in such a way that it will be difficult for you to
forgive in the following opportunities.

This is how it happens with all the healthy, positive, good habits that we want to
incorporate into our emotional intimacy.

No one becomes overnight, nor sanctifies in brief moments,
just because it accepted new concepts or matured values in a way
Positive.

Anyone who decides to become better, needs a companion
inseparable: persistence.

Imagine wanting to free yourself from tobacco addiction. As much as the
decision is taken, as much as medical and therapeutic assistance is
without persistence in intent, there will be no success.

With bad moral habits occurs in the same way. If we want to become a
less selfish person, or less proud, or even if what bothers us is the
that we are very arrogant and would like to change the way we act, the
persistence will be desired to us companion.

Every change requires effort, energy, investment. And it is natural even if, at the
walk the road to new directions, let's stumble, let's feel a little
lost or sometimes even a tip of repentance... After all, it was before
so easier, we thought...

In these moments, perseverance will be the tool to push us forward, the
stimulate us to continue the march, to give the courage to insist on the process
of change, improvement, to be.

There will always be those who discourage progress from us. Moral pygmies that the
are, not having the courage to change themselves, bother to see that others get
they strive, try to improve.

Since they don't have the guts to do it, they don't want others to do it.

*   *   *

Let us not be carried away by the pessimism of some or by the discouragement of
Other.

Every change for the better is God's desire for us, for as our Father,
wishes the best for His children. But as a loving Father, he knows that he must start from
each of us the initiative and effort to be better.

Persist in good, insist on the effort of personal improvement so that good wins
space in our intimacy is wise investment to which we must all dispose of,
as soon as possible.

Only through personal and individual effort will we be able to follow the
way to building happiness in our intimacy, when feelings
will give way to light and peace in our emotional structure.
