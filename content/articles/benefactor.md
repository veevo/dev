Pain has been, in all times of humanity, a constant among beings.

It installs unexpectedly and becomes, from there, to be the center of
attention, modifying plans, changing directions.

When hated, their reactions are violent, becoming even stronger.
When accepted, its effects are milder.

The truth is that pain is made known to everyone and no one can prevent you from
Presence.

It takes on the most varied facets and after it ends a cycle, prepares,
for a new beginning, his timely appearance.

Now it is the economic difficulties that afflict, sometimes the affective loneliness that the
money can't placate.

There is hatred that tears apart the intimate tissues of being, there are the claws of
irreversible diseases that reduce dust the most sincere hopes.

They are loves who leave for the other plan of life, without even one last
Goodbye. These are lies that destroy dreams and ward off friends hearts.

Pain, as a divine tool of purification, submits and reaches, without exception,
all creatures.

The boastful, who disregard her, do not reach the end of the journey without
experience the company.

The proud, who despise her, considering herself unreachable, find her
just ahead.

Your siege is invincible.

Instrument of God's Law, pain serves as an anonymous benefactor that to all
Visit.

Its action is not the result of chance, nor can it be considered as a
unfair occurrence.

Our tribulations are nothing more than consequences of misconceptions of the past,
requiring the proper repair and proper redemption.

These are repercussions of the violation of divine laws.

These are benditas occasions of learning and redoing.

The pain, which to many amoesquinha, humiliates and stuns, must be a stimulus of
growth and evolution, so that we achieve the great victory over us
Same.

We don't be afraid. Let us not allow ourselves to be overwhelmed by suffering and the feeling of
self-commiseration.

When a cause of pain or contravenity strikes us, we raise ourselves above the
circumstances, dominating the impulses of impatience, anger or
Despair.

We can, by their own will, tame or overcome pain, or at least make
her means of elevation.

Pain is used to polish, cut, sculpt and build true qualities
of the immortal Spirit.

Let us remember: blessed are the afflicted because they have the opportunity to prove the
his faith, his firmness, his perseverance and his submission to God's will.
And because after the storm, they will have the joys that they lack on Earth.

                                   *   *   *

Happiness is not from this world.

Pain will be necessary until men guide their acts, thoughts and
words according to eternal laws.

All the afflictions of the present are the fruit of a mistaken past.

Neither fortune, nor power, not even youth in bloom are conditions
essential to happiness.

There are people who hold everything that is missing from others and also do not feel happy.

Let us use faith as the right remedy for suffering. It always points out the
horizons of infinity, before which the few days of shadow of the
This.
