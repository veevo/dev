Have you noticed that these days, appeals are immense for us
become more and more consumerist?

In magazines and newspapers, on radio, television and on the Internet,
shopping invitations seem to be everywhere.

Not even in the elevators and on the streets we are safe: billboards,
posters, electronic panels, brochures and all kinds of advertisements are
reach of our eyes and hands.

It's the excess of our day. We live an almost artificial life, in which,
gradually, simplicity and real values are being replaced by things
artificial and fleeting.

Instead of our conversations with family and neighbors, now we've spent
hours in front of the TELEVISION or computer. We're blind to those who live
beside us.

We stopped listening to the world, to isolate us in headphones. And
we ended up becoming a little deaf to reality.

And so our life continues, increasingly mechanized, increasingly
driven by the products we buy non-stop, stimulated by the advertisements and
Advertisements.

And that doesn't just happen to adults. Children are bombed
advertising, since it was discovered that they powerfully influence the
parents, not only to buy toys, but also to buy cars,
appliances and food products.

It's interesting to remember that advertising makes us believe we need
have things. She infiltrates us, commanding her will.

It is used for concepts important to the human being: acceptance, joy,
Welfare.

On the other hand, the strength of propaganda also affects us by informing
that if we don't have certain things or services, we are unhappy or excluded
social groups.

But the problem is not in advertisers or advertisers. They
do their job. The problem is in us, which we believe and accept,
as truths, commercialones.

It's a case of tuning. We passively accept the message of advertising
and we go further: we identify with her.

We come to believe that we will be happy only if we have objects
expensive or famous brands.

Gradually, we become slaves to the need to buy.
Cosmetics, food, electronic devices - everything becomes the subject of
I wish.

That's when we unreservedly give ourselves to the advertising message.

To free ourselves from this slavery, we have the willpower, the
ability to resist and free will.

Therefore, Spiritual Masters of all times, peoples and religions
warned the man to fight unbridled desires.

In India, Krishna and Buddha warned of the wishes that command the
human actions and recommended eliminating them in order to achieve liberation.

And Jesus of Nazareth warned that, wherever our treasure is, there will be
our hearts.

If we focus our focus on things, people or situations we want, it is
to this we will be bound, even after the death of the body.

On the contrary, if our attention is turned to God, to the
experience of the ethics and values of the Spirit, we will certainly overcome the desires
that they imprison and walk towards permanent purity and joy.

Think about it!
