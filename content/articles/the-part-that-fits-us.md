When Jesus guided us on the idea that our right hand should not know
what the left does, intended to teach us that we should not do
publicity of the good we practice.

After all, when we do something good the motivation for such an attitude should not be the
pride or the desire for us to be publicly noticed or recognized by
Right.

This practice must be stimulated by the awareness that we can and should
do something for others.

But what to do?

Many people regret not being able to do all the good they would want for lack of
material resources.

However, much remains to be done, which dispenses with the application of a large sum of
financial resources.

If we do not have economic availability to assist the less favoured in the
life, perhaps we can donate our time for them.

Although there is not much media disclosure about it, we know that there are
many organized groups developing various volunteer work.

There are groups of ladies who weekly sew flaps that collect to
make blankets for needy families.

There are those who teach what they know for those who have not had the same opportunities,
developing sleeping potentials, revealing new horizons.

That's human promotion.

Groups of volunteers are willing to teach computer science in needy centers to
in order to initiate in such knowledge people who would never have access to these
resources by the usual means.

There are music teachers forming corals and giving the first notions about this
art, for children living in slums, in situations of misery.

There are health professionals who organize and offer their time, attending
free of charge in community offices, installed in neighborhoods of extreme
Poverty.

There are also those who assume to assist a child, or a family,
giving them the support they can be.

There are countless good anonymous Samaritans, all over the world.

They are people who offer to suffering brothers, not only material goods, but
much more valuable things: time and dedication.

If we really want to build a better world, let's do our part.

There's a lot to be done. So many sufferers.

Elderly people wait for years in asylums to visit someone who is willing to
listen to them.

Children need the safe guidance of someone who can teach them and
guide them through noble and worthy examples.

Many are people who have not had a chance to learn a trade or even the
read and write, waiting for an opportunity in this sense.

                                   *   *   *

We have in our hands talents and resources eroded by idleness and
Selfishness.

How many hours do we spend on TV without anything?

How many weekends we spend in cars, from side to side,
without actually going anywhere?

How much life do we go through without doing anything useful and profitable?

There is no reason, no sense, to delay our effective action in good.

Let's do our part from now on, whatever it is.

Let's think about it.
