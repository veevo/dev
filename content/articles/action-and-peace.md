Peace action

Peace is one of the most desired treasures today. Much has been invested
to get some of that precious good.

But, have we individually made effective investments to
such an achievement?

What usually happens is that we have invested our efforts in the direction
contrary, and improperly.

It is very common if you wish for peace and seek it for crooked paths, which end up in the
distancing her further.

The Emmanuel Spirit, through the mediumship of Chico Xavier, wrote, certain
a message that entitled Peace Action:

Condensed distress is similar to short fuse bomb, ready to explode the
any sbumling contact.

Indispensable to know how to preserve its own tranquility, so that we are useful
in the extinction of this or that difficulty.

I am sure that in order to cooperate in the establishment of peace, we would not be lawful
interpret calm by inertia.

Patience is understanding that acts without noise, in support of general security.

Reflecting with the right, it receives the time of crisis without any idea of violence,
because violence always induces the strangulation of the opportunity to assist.

Faced with any disastrous information, seekto coat you with serenity
possible so that you do not become a problem, weighing on the problem that the
life asks you to solve.

Do not drown thought in the clouds of pessimism, mentalizing occurrences
unfortunate that they will probably never show up.

Avoids judging people and situations in a negative sense so that repentance
do not erode your spirit's forces.

If you find yourself facing an assault case, don't answer with another
aggression, so that mental intemperance does not precipitate you in the ditch of
Delinquency.

It pacifies one's own sensitivity, so that reason guides you to impulses.

If you preserve the habit of praying, you use prayer in difficult moments, but if you
you do not have this blessing, meditate sufficiently before speaking or acting.

The emotional impacts, anywhere, arise on everyone's road; Guard
therefore faith in God and in yourself, so that you do not depart from peace
interior, so that in the dark hours of existence may your peace
become blessed light.

Emmanuel's lucid words suggest profound reflections around the
our daily action.

It is important that, in the search for peace, we will not be causeful disorder and
Violence.

By creating an environment of peace in one's own intimacy, we can collaborate in an action
peace reigns in our home first, and then can be
extend the world out.

If a person is permanently in peace, the world around him
benefit from this attitude.

And if world peace is not yet a reality on our planet, let us make peace in our
intimate world. This attitude depends only on a single decision: ours.

                                  *   *    *

Our inner peace is capable of neutralizing the hatred of many creatures.

If we keep the flame of peace in our intimacy on the lights, then we can
believe that world peace is very close.

Because, in fact, the peace of the world begins in the depths of each of us.
