Have you ever smiled today?

It's probably not realizing the value of the smile.

This set of goulate gems you bring in your mouth, when showing up in the
impulse of his joy, is able to move incredible obstacles, to transform
occurrences or of illuminating lives.

It's very easy to smile. The smile is very simple. It's like breathing.

Understandable is that you feel shy to perform a little kindness
for lack of habit; give someone a seat; load a package for some
elderly, pregnant woman or for those who are in difficulty; provide information
willingly or silence before some evil provocation.

After all, in the land ways, the criminal cleverness, granfina pornography, the
daily violence, the imbalance, is that they usually receive applause, deserve
newspaper pages and turn television news almost always.

Think, however, that it is essential that we learn to create intimacy with the
Kindness.

It becomes very simple to do good as long as you are not overwhelmed by
sorrows, guilt, greedy yearning or intimate rebellious ness.

In the effort to enjoy each of your days, do as much good as you can, any
that he be, wherever you are, because good always responds with new well, that
it goes invariably to the people who gave him a birth.

Very good and easy to be developed is the act focused on goodness, for the
kindness, for kindness at any level.

Practice good in any of its dimensions, whether objectively or subjectively,
it means accumulating joy and harmony in one's own heart.

                                   *   *   *

Wherever we are, wherever we go, let's not look at extending the smile, by offer
sublime of one's own soul.

He is the agent who neutralizes the power of evil and inarticulate prayer, which inhibits
the extent of darkness.

With it, we will put out the cholera fire, surrounding the door to the fire of the
Cruelty.

For him, we will extend the planting of hope, lifting souls fallen in the
shadow, so that they may return to the light.

At home, it is the blessing of peace, in the heartofment of trust.

At work, it's silent music encouraging cooperation.

In the world, it's a call of sympathy.

Smiling at the difficulty, the difficulty will turn into the help of our
Life.

Smiling at the cloud, and even if the cloud falls apart in rain of
tears in our eyes, the weeping will be comfort of heaven, to fertilize us the
fields of the heart.

It does not ask us for the desperate solution of the riddle of suffering that haunts you the
Destination. Implores us a smile of love, which renews the forces, so that
continue on your tormented path.

And, in fact, if the hungry and the naked ask us for bread and sweater, they expect us
above all, the smile of tenderness and understanding that calms them wounds
Hidden.

Let us not condemn creatures that dare to the precipices of violence and
Crime. Let us offer the generous smile of fraternity, which helps
incessantly, and will turn, renewed, to the roadmap of good.

Smiling, working and learning, helping and loving always.

Let us remember that the smile is the dew of charity and that every morning, the day
renascente in heaven is a smile of God.
