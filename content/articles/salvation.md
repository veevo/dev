The idea of salvation has long occupied the thought of humanity.

However, the concept remains undefined.

After all, what exactly does salvation consist of?

It will be a magical process that suddenly transmutes a selfish and flawed being into a
angel of love and mercy?

Men have always sought gurus and saviors.

Not in the sense of a master whose examples must be imitated and the
teachings, followed.

But as someone who does the hard work.

There is a certain taste for the wonderful, easy and quick solutions.

According to some conceptions, simply believe in a Higher Being to be saved or
Redeemed.

By the work and grace of a third, the creature's problems disappear and it disappears
transports to an ideal world.

Then, then, everything is rest and idleness.

Moral fissures disappear and there are no more doubts or challenges.

Strictly speaking, you don't have the same anymore, but another totally different, without
any link with the former.

Some people check out some rites the power to provoke this amazing
Transformation.

However, within the Christian level, it is not possible to look at the evangelical principle
that says:

Every one according to his works.

In the book The Comforter, the Spirit Emmanuel, through the psychography of the medium
Francisco Cândido Xavier, take care of the subject.

According to him, the salvation of the soul must be understood as self-enlightenment, the
path of the highest achievements.

That is, the being himself lights up.

It is not a mere use of third-party effort.

Emmanuel states that the Gospel is the roadmap for the rise of all
Spirits.

Spiritual light takes place from the gospel's experience.

It is concluded that salvation is the result of a laborious process of
self-illumination.

The candidate must strive to follow the examples and teachings of Christ.

You need to abandon lower trends and addictions.

Break with old habits and make a commitment to be better every day.

Cease with malevolence, pornography, laziness, dishonesty and everything else that
incompatible with the title of Christian.

Salvation is a commitment that man assumes with his conscience.

It is a matter of maturity, of taking responsibility for the
immortal existence.

There are no miracles and no easy solution.

One doesn't do the hard work for the other.

Redemption is the result of a lot of effort and discipline.

The being appears redeemed when it is ready for the experience of the purest
Fraternity.

When you really internalized the idea that you should treat others as
i would like to be treated.

When you no longer allow rascalities and disloyalties.

When the pain of the next touches deep in his heart.

By redeeming himself, the Spirit frees himself from evil.

By understanding the difficulties of those of the other people, forgives with ease and does not allow the
evil of the world contaminates him.

Knowing how difficult and laborious it is to purify, it becomes indulgent with
other people's imperfections.

And he does everything he can, because he feels intense compassion for the fellow.

Such a state of soul frees the Spirit from the circles of suffering and enables him to
sublime experiences in debugged worlds.

That's the meaning of salvation.

Think about it.
