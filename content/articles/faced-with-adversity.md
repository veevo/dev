Recovering from a tumble is not a task of the easiest, we must agree.

Not everyone can put into practice the popular refrain: Raises,
shakes the dust and turns it around, created in the music of Paulo Vanzolini.

Often, when we fall for whatever reason, as is the end of a
relationship; the loss of a job; an accident, or even the pressure of the
day by day, we tend to get stuck on the floor.

How to continue? How to move on? Is it worth all the effort again?

Fortunately there are people who manage to get around all this with greater
Ease.

Even when everything seems to conspire negatively, they go ahead, with a
smile on her face and willing to face whatever it takes.

Intrigued to find out what led some people to face these so well
setbacks of life, experts in human behavior began to study
the traits of these survivors.

The former concluded that it was an innate invulnerability,
something like a real gift with which people were born.

However, it seems that this did not answer everything, and just over a decade ago
began to investigate the term invulnerability.

This seemed to suggest that people would be 100% immune to any kind of
adversity - which would not be reality.

While they are people who go through problems more easily, this does not
it means that they come out of these experiences totally unharmed.

The scholars began to seek a more appropriate term, and it was then that
borrowed a terminology of physics: resilience.

Resilience is a property of some materials, which shows its ability to
return to its original state after undergoing great pressure.

So would people with a high degree of resilience: they would have the ability to
face adversity as an opportunity to show and improve their
competence, your enthusiasm.

Such people also find creative and determined solutions to
get up off the ground.

Right now you may be wondering what your degree of resilience is,
Sure?

It is worth noting here that being resilient is not being indifferent, insensitive.

It's not about feeling or not feeling, it's about how to cross the
Experiences.

It would be a skill, which we can all acquire, to endure suffering,
extracting everything you have to teach us from it. There's the key to everything.

Léon Denis states with property that if, in the hours of trial, we knew
observe the inner work, the mysterious action of pain in us, we would understand
his sublime work of education and improvement.

                                   *   *   *

The reason for human pain comes from divine protection.

Peoples are families of God who, in the manner of great flocks, are called
to the arisk of the High.

Earth is the way. The struggle that teaches and builds is the march.

Suffering is always the sting that awakens the distracted sheep on the margin of the
true patha.
