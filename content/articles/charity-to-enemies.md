Why charity for someone who did so badly? That shattered lives, which
did you bring deep unhappiness to so many people?

Perhaps these are the thoughts of most of us when we are invited to
act with benevolence towards those who vilified the world with their gestures of
Evil.

Why be good with who you didn't go with? Why act well with those who hurt us?

To this day these ideas can't find echo in our souls. We've seen from times of the
eye for an eye, of time to pay good with good and evil with evil. It's millennia
of primitivism speaking in our hearts.

Understandable that we still have so much difficulty in assimilating ideas and
different proposals from these.

However, it is necessary to mature. Our intelligence is already capable of connections, of
understandings, which were not possible for us before.

Jesus was the first to revolving human intimacy by proposing treatment
different from those considered bad.

First showing that we all bring difficulties, that we fall and we can still
Fall. Evidencing that evil is a disease that can reach everyone.

Therefore he warned of judgments: He who is without sin shoots the
first stone.

He proposed the pardon of offenses to get rid of the hatred he consumes
first to those who bring it into the soul.

Finally, proposing love to enemies, perhaps the most difficult teaching of
experience it. Something out of the reality of our planet.

How to love someone we can neither support nor see, who causes us harm, who
Harms?

Well, we need to use intelligence and understand the spirit behind the
letter: Jesus did not intend, so speaking, that each of us has for his
enemy the same tenderness that we dispense to a friend or brother.

Tenderness presupposes confidence. Now, no one can place trust in a person
knowing that she wants you badly.

There is still the question of affinity and bonding, sometimes impossible.

The poverty of our language requires us to serve as a term for
express various nuances of a feeling. The reason will then establish the
Differences.

Loving enemies is therefore not having an affection that is not in the
nature, since the contact of an enemy makes us beat a different heart.

To love enemies is not to keep hatred, no grudge, no desire for revenge.
It is forgiving them without hidden thinking and conditions, the evil they have caused us.

It is also not to oppose any obstacle to reconciliation with them. It is to wish them the
well and not evil. It is to experience joy, rather than grief, with the good that
Reach.

Finally, it is to help them, in presenting themselves occasion and reciprocate evil with good,
without the intention of humiliating.

                                   *   *   *

Love for enemies seems far from our possibilities. If impossible
whether, however, Jesus, the Model and Guide of Humanity, would not have proposed it with
so objectivity.

All we have to do is take it one step at a time. Today is to avoid revenge.
Tomorrow, stop hating. Later, until you wish for good and, who knows, power
Help.

In this way, we will be moving towards this nuance of love so different and
rare still on Earth.
