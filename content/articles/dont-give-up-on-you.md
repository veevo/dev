Sometimes you don't understand how people can still smile in a world
like that.

Walks the streets and sees no grace in the movement to come and go from people, no
finds joy in the vivacity of children and does not realize these supposed
good things life has.

The news speaks of conspiracies, coups, slaughter. They worsen indexes of this
or that. And you're sure it's not worth investing any effort
in this existence.

There's also some kind of emptiness in there. A pain in the mouth of the stomach or in the
lungs, a difficulty breathing sometimes. You don't know what it is.
does everyone have that?

You study by obligation or work only for the financial result. Now
you need to eat, you need a place to live, buy some things...
But sometimes you wonder if it's worth fighting for it.

You have times that you eat more than you need, others that you stay many hours without
and realizes that this is not much lacking. I could even live without...

You realize people are isolating themselves. Everyone in your corner. So don't
He talks about you a lot. In fact, you can spend hours and hours without uttering a single
Word.

We're hiding behind the screens! " You heard a specialist say. And in the
his free hours remain there, in that world that seems to have no end, but that
sometimes it also looks like a lot of emptiness.

The internet seems full of people but at the same time empty. I go in and out of this
supposed digital world in the same way – these are thoughts that acode it.

You've been tired of everything, everyone. People aren't interesting. There's no
patience for almost no one.

From time to time a deep sadness strikes, as if opening an abyss in the
Chest. You want to cry, but you can't. You don't understand what that is.
You feel lonely.

                                   *   *   *

Here are some special words for you.

First, prolonged loneliness is not allowed. Count on someone to talk to,
to open up. Someone you trust, someone you can describe these
strange things you think, that you feel or see around you.

Don't miss the reference of love, those who want you well. We all have these
our back. We all have those who are willing to reach out to us, or just
Hear.

You're not alone.

We haven't just been abandoned in a world that goes from bad to worse. This is
another distorted view. It is a terrorist vision that many have become accustomed to
pass or accept. Don't judge the world just listening to one side.

There's a lot of love in people. The Universe is coordinated out of love, although it is still
we have difficulty understanding certain mechanisms of their laws.

See how this message is coming to you. There is no coincidence, no
there is chance. Everything is in its proper place and help reaches those who need it and in the
the right time.

Don't give up on you. Don't give up on your ideals, dreams, goals. If it is
necessary, rebuild, rebuild, ask for help from someone specialized and
remake your steps.

Notice if symptoms you have are not linked to some type of disorder
Emotional. We're all subject to these difficulties.

Finally, remember that the opportunity of the incarnation is the greatest treasure that
we may have received it. Enjoy every moment.
