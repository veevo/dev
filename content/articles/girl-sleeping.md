According to the Gospel, on one occasion Jesus was called to intervene in
favor of the daughter of a man named Jairus.

However, before they arrived at the house where the sick was, the
news that she had already died.

Jesus comforted the afflicted father and told him that nothing should fear.

When they reached their destination, there was a lot of crying and uproar.

Entering the residence, Jesus said there was no reason to weeping, for the
girl just slept.

Taking the hand of Jairus's daughter, said: Girl, get up and walk, being
immediately obeyed.

                                   *   *   *

This beautiful Gospel passage is several lines of reflection.

Spiritual sleep sometimes resembles death.

Those who observe those who sleep do not rarely believe him dead for the issues
Spiritual.

Cruelty and indifference are identified as terminal states.

The cruel man does not raise sympathy and the idea arises that he never
will recover in moral terms.

Likewise, the selfish creature seems to jazer in a skiff of indifference.

Precisely for this, those who consider themselves awake and active give up
efforts in favor of them.

As in the Gospel passage, they understand that there is only regret for moral death
of these creatures.

However, life is inexhaustible and no one has ever been definitively transrouted.

Many are bought in manslaughter, away from the responsibilities that fit them
in the society in which they live.

Others even show moral putrefaction, allowing themselves great rascalities.

In order not to give themselves to the effort of intimate renewal, they opt for the sleep of the
Negligence.

This sleep can last millennia, denote rebellion with the higher purposes
of immortal existence.

Those who sleep are even cranky with whom it signals the need to
Lift.

They cling to various species of anesthesia of the soul.

They give themselves to the enjoyment of ephemeral sensations, to the search for power, even justified
adherence to currents of thought focused on selfishness.

But there's always time to wake up.

Intimate growth is a divine design and no one gets rid of it.

Whether through great love, a deep pain or even for the bitterness that the
illusions of the world produce.

Sooner or later, the reality of life is imposed and the need to become
fraternal and pure appears.

Gradually, the appetite for worldly things ceases and an empty bleak
installs in the soul.

This void can only be filled by the fulfillment of the loving invitation of the
Divine Messiah: Lift up and walk!

Aware of this, speed up your awakening by reflection on messages
Christian.

And also never allow yourself to consider your fellowmen as lost!

One by one, everyone will awaken to the sublime beauty of the thriving and immortal love.
