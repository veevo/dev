We've had the impression for days that we've reached the end of the road. We look at
front and we no longer see output. There is no light at the end of the tunnel, and there is no
also no possibility back.

It seems that all our projects, our goals, have been taken for good
distant, and we are unable to reach them.

It even seems that the autumn of existence caused them to dry our
hopes and the strong winter wind swept all dreams out of our hands
acalentados.

Death comes and snatches the affections of our soul leaving us our hearts
Torn apart.

We feel lost. We don't know what course to take. We were astonished.

We feel like a dry tree, no leaves, no glare, no reason for
Live. It's hopelessness.

Suddenly, as with nature, spring changes the entire landscape. The
dry trees fill with green buds, and are soon covered with leaves and
Flowers.

The grayish tone gives way to the green colors of thousand shades. It's hope.

The expensive loved ones, who preceded us on the journey back to the Spiritual Homeland,
one day they will be again with our late hearts, in a hug of
affection and affection.

Everything in nature comes back to smile. The green grass is embroidered with flowers of
varied hues, butterflies dance in the air, the birds toast them with their
harmonious symphonies. Everything is life.

So when the flame of hope rekindles in our hearts, our dreams
defects are replaced by other longings. Our goals change and
enthusiasm invades our souls.

Jesus the Sublime Galileo spoke to us of hope in the Sermon on the Mountain, with the
gentle corner of the beatitudes.

He exemplified her in His sayings and deeds. Anyway, all His message is
Hope.

If we are visited by any distaste and despair take us in assault,
let us seek our Greatest Friend, Jesus, through prayer.

Predisposing us by prayer, help will certainly come, as soft balm to
penetrate into the most intimate fibers of our being, giving us encouragement and
Tranquility.

If hopelessness comes to us, let us remember Heavenly Friend to say to us: My
burden is light, my yoke is soft.

If Your yoke is soft, why don't we accept Him?

If your burden is light, why don't we drive him?

Let us consider that the rigor of winter may be the result of our lack of
care, submitting us to the yoke of lying, the unmeasured ambition, the
pessimism, of endless complaints...

Or perhaps hopelessness results from our own folly, carrying the
heavy burden of inferior pleasures, pride, selfishness, greed,
vices of every order, and of so many other useless burdens that burden us
his shoulders tearing us down forces.

In this way, under any circumstances, let us let hope invading us to
soul, confident in God, which always gives us new opportunities to remake
paths, seeking our redemption.

Hope must be a constant in our lives.

Hope of better days;

hope of superior achievements;

hope of peace.

It is narrated that a monk who lived from begging, homeless, gathered in a
cave to the night ly rest in beautiful landscape bathed in moonlight.

He fell asleep, a bandit came and stole his cape from which he used as
Sweater.

The cold of the dawn awakened him and, realizing the misfortune, but
fascinated by the clarity of the moon, approached the entrance to the cave, and,
thrilling himself with what he saw, he exclaimed:

I'm glad the thief didn't steal my moon!

And smiling, he meditated.

Despair, never!
