Brazilian Rui Barbosa, great jurist and diplomat, noted writer,
besides extraordinary speaker, left a writing that makes us reflect on the
current situation of our society.

He wrote: "to see the nulities triumph, of so much seeing
prosper the dishonor, from seeing so much injustice grow, of seeing so much
the powers at the hands of the wicked are stirled, man comes to discourage from the
virtue, laughing at honor, to be ashamed of being honest..."

The indignation of Rui Barbosa, even though it was a long time ago,
sense and is worthy of our reflections.

People who get carried away by the opinion of the majority, easily
entangle dwell in dishonesty with the justification that "everyone does".

This is a pitiful misconception, easy to understand with some
Reflections.

Consider that you are a free and independent spirit that survives the
death of the physical body, and which will receive from the laws of life, according to his works.

Consider, still, that you have come into the world only, and will only return, when
reach your time.

You, and only you, will answer for your actions, no one else.

Even if "everyone does", each will be held accountable,
individually, in the face of one's own consciousness.

Thus, do not allow this wave of dishonesty and corruption,
that plagues much of the population, drag you to the sludge as well.

Remember that before your consciousness you will always be alone, without
witness of defense, except his noble acts.

It's not worth giving up the only asset that really gives you
belongs, which is honor, for some money or shady benefit, which will have
that leave in the customs of the tomb.

Dignity is the most valuable heritage anyone can have.
waste with ephemeral things that belong to the earth.

And what's more interesting is that even dishonest people prefer
rely on worthy people, whom they can trust... Strange paradox!

As much as it is said that dishonesty is on the rise, we have seen
true empires collapse because of the lack of ethics.

We have seen prestigious companies and institutions, solid banks,
coming down for forging results, defrauding documents, cheating, extorting...

Companies that do not work with transparency are losing their
investors, who prefer to bet on a relationship of trust.

It can be realized that in the economic environment trust is still the capital
that attracts the most and multiplies the money.

No one, in good conscience, invests in institutions or companies in the
which you don't trust.

And it's important to remember that companies are run by people. And
are the people who give reliability or not to business.

Therefore, the individual is always the bearer of moral values capable of
to build confidence, the only basis capable of sustaining both business and
Friendships.

Undoubtedly these reflections are timely and should make us think of the
Respect.

After all, if dishonesty becomes a general rule of conduct, which
will it be from our society?

So be ashamed of being honest: never!

Think about it, and don't contribute to muddying the lake of hope with the
debris from dishonesty.
