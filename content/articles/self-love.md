Much has been said in these times about self-love.

And many still don't know what self-love really is, confusing him with
selfishness, with vanity.

Self-love has nothing to do with these sick feelings, which leave
show that, deep in the person's depths, fear prevails, insecurity, in
conflicts it still carries itself.

The selfish one doesn't love. He loves possession, his passions, his imbalances.

However, true love is the fuel of life. He's the one who sustains us.
in the journey of progress we crave.

Love is of divine essence, it is the most sublime feeling that can be conceived.

It complains about the lack of true love on the face of the earth, because many expect
only receive love, few are willing to experience it, to donate it.

Many don't even know that the one who doesn't love, can't love anyone,
because you don't realize what you don't have.

Jesus recommended that we love others as ourselves.

How to do this, when you don't have the parameter of love yourself?

Many think that love should be sought out there, but it is within itself that
is the source of this feature.

God is the Father of love and goodness, and as his children, we all possess this seed,
expected to be grown to germinate.

Each one must develop the chance to grow and flourish the love that
brings in you.

When the creature loves itself, it respects itself, values itself, learns to select
attitudes and choices that do you good.

The more you love, the more you disconnect from beliefs, dependencies, people and
harmful situations.

Self-love gives inner balance, provides intellectual, spiritual growth,
emotional, moral.

Self-love holds us before vices and abuses of any order.

Self-love allows magnicement and sublimity in life projects.

For this, it is important to seek self-knowledge, to evaluate postures, feelings,
actions, and change what needs to be changed.

Meditation, for a few minutes daily, allows this inner journey.

It turns out that most of the problems facing each other are not in others,
but in our own heart.

Meditation allows us to observe the causes and solutions for
our problems.

It is perceived then, who we really are, and what we need to change in our
providing opportunities for growth.

Even if we get scared of who we are, we run away from guilt and remorse.

Self-forgiveness is fundamental in this process.

It is important to accept who we are in order to be able to carry out the
autotransformação.

Let us use the current moment to act properly, working on the improvement that
we crave.

The Spiritist Doctrine warns that we are better today than we were yesterday, and
tomorrow, better than we are today.

Knowing each other, accepting us, getting better, we'll end up loving each other.

In loving us, we will be empowered to love others according to the Law in
Asks.

Loving and loving others, close we will be to love God!
