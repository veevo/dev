It tells Greek mythology that, at the beginning of creation, the titan Prometheus was
designated by the gods to organize the matter in confusion, giving rise to the
nature and other forms of animal life.

He promised, however, he asked his brother to take care of everything.

After organizing the Earth, the air and the waters, the man made. And because men
if they felt very lonely, with the help of the other gods created the woman.

He married the first beautiful woman he raised, whom he called Pandora.

I told his wife that everything that existed in her kingdom belonged to her too,
and that she could enjoy everything but could not touch a box that he
kept in one corner of the room.

Telling Pandora not to touch it was enough to awaken her to
Curiosity. The first moment she found herself alone, in the huge mansion, she sought
the box and opened it.

As soon as he lifted the chest cover, they came out of his intimacy the miserys more
Varied.

Physical miseries such as leprosy, gout, migraines, cancer, among others
diseases, which were closed, escaped and spread themselves upon the
Whole humanity.

Envy, anger, pride, selfishness, moral miseries that were also
stored, spread throughout the earth.

Pandora, frightened, closed the box immediately, without realizing that in the
background was saved hope.

                                   *   *   *

Men, frightened by so many moral and physical miseries that hang over the
Humanity, think that God has forgotten the human race, relegating him to his own
So.

However, hope remains for all of us.

One day, in a distant country, hope dressed as a man and emerged like a sun
to reverse the situation of humanity suffered.

He became known as Jesus the Christ.

But carelessly, most men can only see Him as a loser,
overcome on the cross of martyrdom, with no chance of helping.

Forgotten that He broke the tombstone of the tomb and appeared alive, stating to
who wanted to hear Him:

I'm here! And on another occasion, he said, "You'll never be alone."

                                   *   *   *

Jesus remains alive and watching for humanity, whom he called His flock.

What a ray of hope, came up bringing the message of the Good News and spread it by
the whole planet.

He told us about the kingdom of God. He sang eternal beatitudes. And never if
he had news that He has let himself be contaminated by human miseries.

Jesus, therefore, is the living message of hope. Live and sail for us.

These words are from Him: Come unto me that you are tired, that I
aliviarei.

If physical and moral miseries are becoming unbearable, let us open the
our Pandora's box and let out of it the great hope:

Jesus!

                                   *   *   *

There's no harm that lasts forever.

The Atakama Desert, the most arid in the world, situated in Chile, upon receiving the
first drops of refreshing water, after almost a century without rains, in little
time is covered with beautiful multicolored flowers.

So it also happens to the most empedernidas souls. When they open up to
receive the first rays of the sun of souls, Jesus, change the dry landscape,
to become flowery fields, spreading blessings wherever they pass.
