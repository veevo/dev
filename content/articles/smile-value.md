It costs nothing and yields much.

It enriches those who receive it without impoverishing who gives it.

It only lasts an instant, but its effects last forever.

No one's so rich he doesn't need it. No one is so poor that i can't
give to everyone.

It brings happiness to everyone and everywhere.

It's the symbol of friendship, of goodwill. It is encouragement for discouraged, home
for the weary, sunshine for the sad, comfort to the desperate.

You don't buy or lend yourself.

No currency in the world can pay its value.

Do you know what this is about?

It's a smile.

And there's no one who needs a smile as much as those who don't know
more smile.

Those who have lost hope. Those who wander aimlessly. Those who do not
believe more that happiness is something possible.

It's so easy to smile! Everything gets nicer if on our lips there is a smile.

Everything gets easier if there is on the lips of those who coexist with us a smile
Sincere.

Some of us think we should only smile at the people with whom
we sympathize.

There are so many who cross our path daily. Some with the spark
carried by taking in the intimate the bitterness of the rough walk. Can
collaborate with an open smile, at least so that that person may stop and
realize that someone smiles at you, since the smile is a boost.

Smile as you meet the little ones who run at the traffic lights looking for coins.

It's so sad to have to beg and even sadder is to receive words and gestures
aggressive as an answer.

If it is true that this situation bothers us, it is no less true that it does not
we'd like to be in their shoes.

They're so tiny!

If they have the malice of adults, it's because adults induce them to do it. But in the
are innocent strained to look smart, amid more
Adverse.

Smile is a powerful weapon, from which we can serve ourselves in all
Situations.

If, as we get up in the morning, we greet the family members with a wide
smile, our day will certainly be better, more joyful.

If, as we enter the elevator, we greet with a smile those who follow with us,
rather than close our faces and look up or down in an attempt
to look away, surely our day will be happier. Because everyone
you will see us with sympathy and address us healthy energies.

The smile is always good for those who smile and even better for those who receive it.

The smile has the power to make our walk more mild.

That way, if we don't have a habit of taking our lives smiling, let's start
cultivate it, and we will see that without changing the situation around us, we,
intimately, we will feel happier.

                                   *   *   *

The loaded spark, that is, the face tied, as they say, brings to the
body a wear greater than that promoted by smile.

This means that when we smile, we use fewer muscles and do less
Efforts.

Therefore, even for the sake of economics, it is more advantageous to smile.
