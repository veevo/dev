Every time we meet someone, we imagine things about you.

We usually claim that the first impression is the one that is.

This well reflects the precipitation with which we judge others.

Do we have a condition that we evaluate the character of others at first?

It is inevitable that by catching contact with someone, we will do a preliminary analysis
of his person.

But caution is needed about this first impression.

Shy or reserved persons may be considered unsympathetic to the first
Look.

Mocking or frivolous creatures may seem only cheerful in contact
superficial.

We need to keep an open mind for a possible review of the initial impact
that someone provokes us.

Before knowing a person deeply, we must avoid forming firm opinion
and irrevocable about his character.

Sometimes we experience an influx of immediate and deep sympathy for a new
Friend.

Still, it is convenient to know you better, before opening life and
Heart.

As far as some people are concerned, we feel immediate dislike.

Similarly, we should not close the door to fraternal understanding, only with
based on a hunch.

It is imperative to control the first impulse, to learn to see the essence of the person
before labeling it as good or bad.

That is, we must learn to use reason in our social coexistence.

Not much proximity, nor cold ice, before knowing better who arrives in
our lives.

Having emotional caution so doesn't mean being a bad Christian.

It is impossible to ignore the nature of the world in which we live, where there is still a lot of
ignorance and violence.

Often, by readily sympathizing with someone, we allow ourselves to great
Intimacies.

We received the newly known in our house, told our secrets without
any caution.

But then we felt entitled to claim that the new friend let us down,
that it wasn't as it appeared to be.

It turns out that the other is as it is, not as we think it should be.

No one has an obligation to meet our expectations.

The expectations are ours. We are the ones who created them, in our absence of
Discernment.

When we say that someone let us down, we should think that the
responsibility for the disappointment is ours.

We're the ones who created a false image. The other has nothing to do with our illusion.

We're all fallible, because we're human.

It is important that we educate our emotions, not to expect from others more than
that they can give.

It is necessary to know the next one well before qualifying it from this or
like that.

When we perceive it as it is, with its faults and virtues, it will be easier
identify the correct way to live with it.

With discretion and discernment, we will discover the people with whom we have real
Affinity.

Aware of who we relate to, we may want everyone well, without
prejudices or unrealistic expectations.

We will be more useful to others, the more we understand it in essence.

Realizing the difficulties of the fellow, and yet wanting him well, is a sign
of emotional and spiritual maturity.

Let us therefore take care of the first impression that the other causes us.

We must educate our emotions so that we are not governed by impulses.

The reason enlightened by love is that it must conduct our acts.

Let's think about it.
