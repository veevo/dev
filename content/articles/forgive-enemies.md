Nothing comforted that maternal heart. Whoever visited her could discover her, of
immediate, the pitiful state.

It looked like a shadow moving between the four walls of the home.

He cried and misled what happened.

His two children, on the way to school, had been harvested by a motorcycle, in
high speed.

The biker had lost control, invaded the sidewalk and played the two small
against a pole.

With serious injuries, they were taken to the hospital immediately. But no
Resisted.

That mother's revolt wasn't big. And among the pain of the absence of children
loved ones, harvested by death, cried out for justice.

That boy had to be punished hard.

After some time, she learned that the biker had survived and was in the
hospital, badly injured.

A friend, who had been visiting him, came to tell her that, in the moments when she acquired
lucidity, begged forgiveness for what it had caused.

I wish I could apologize, even though I knew nothing would bring back the lives of
two little creatures.

The days have gone by. And finally, Wilma decided to visit him, carried away by a
Friend.

He was under the effect of strong sedatives, taking at his side a woman
suffered and tearful. It was your mother.

It was then that Wilma realized that the suffering was not only his.
That woman suffered from her son's pain. Also by the judicial judgment that,
in the future, he would have to face.

Something moved Wilma. They were two mothers who cried their children: one by those who
had broken and the other for the present and future pains of the son.

And Wilma came back and returned to the hospital. He started talking to that mother, and
heard, over and over again, the boy's request for forgiveness, to the extent that he improved
his physical state.

He knew he had made a mistake. Impatience will lead him to accelerate and accelerate.
It was inconsequential. And now I knew how much.

I couldn't fix what I had done. Justice would judge him, he knew. But that's not
would comfort that maternal heart.

                                   *   *   *

Suffering usually hardens our senses.

The first reaction of those who suffer an assault, trauma or setback
is automatic review, without in-depth analysis of the situation and conditions of the
Attacker.

The idea that we can solve the impasses rationally and enlightened is
regarded as foolish ness for many.

Surprise cause when calmer and enlightened people seek to normalize
situations with only a respectful gesture or dialogue.

It is the law greater the duty to love each other.

And how pleasurable to meet a friend who brings us to heart feelings
joyful and healthy.

In these moments we feel closer than we call happiness.

When we have to remake a friendship that has been overstated for any reason,
our heart seems to make blooming.

By getting someone hurt to review their posture and all start over from the beginning
for the purpose of peace, we end up happy with the joy that arises.

                                   *   *   *

Loving those who love us is comfortable, it's easy.

Loving the disaffections, those who harm us, make us suffer is more difficult.

However, it all starts in the process of trying to apologize, then forgive. And
finally, stop wanting badly to those who have hurt us.

This is the way of love.

If love for others represents the principle of charity, loving enemies is the
most sublime application of that principle.

The possession of such virtue represents one of the greatest victories achieved against the
selfishness and pride.
