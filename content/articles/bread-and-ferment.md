Bread is one of the oldest man-produced foods. It is part of the
History of Humanity and, in addition to being food for the body, also symbolizes
food for the Spirit.

Originally done in a rustic way, it was being increasingly elaborate,
getting new ingredients, making it soft, tasty and looking
Inviting.

To make a good bread few ingredients are needed, but one should
respect the fermentation time of the dough.

A good yeast makes the mass light and yeasts aerating the dough, make it
avolute leaving the fluffy bread. A bad yeast does not light the dough, and the bread gets
heavy, hard to digest.

In their dissemination trips of the Good News, due to the number of churches that
had founded and from the great distances between them, the Apostle Paul no longer
i was able to visit everyone personally as often as it would be desirable.

Thus, to clarify doubts and guide the difficulties that
had the inspiration of writing letters, known as Epistles.

In one of these letters, addressed to the church of Corinth, he warns about the
pride, the risk of deviations along the way and guides on the need for
renewal, comparing human attitudes to the baking process.

The Apostle of Tarsus advises us to free ourselves from old leaven, from leaven
of evil and malice, to become new mass, without yeast.

In short, he calls on everyone to use sincerity and truth.

The old yeast to which he referred are the vices, the imperfections that
we insist on maintaining, denying ourselves to the undertaking of moral reform so
urgent and necessary for our spiritual evolution.

In the same way that a poor quality yeast can ruin the breads of all
a force, dominated by vices, evil, pride, selfishness
harm to those who live with us.

Our words and deeds have scope that we don't know. Just like yeast,
they can nest in the other people's minds, taking them away, that is,
multiplying-se.

Therefore, we have a duty to take care of the quality of what we spread to our
around, be it words, vibrations, or actions.

                                   *   *   *

What kind of yeast and bread are we offering to those who live with us? With
what feelings are we nourishing the Spirit of those around us?

After all, what kind of bread are we producing? Soft quality, tasty to
Taste? Or a bitter, hard bread, without the slightest condition of doing well to those of it
feeds?

It is possible to make a bread without yeast. But even in this case, the quality of
ingredients is important.

If we do not have the yeast that multiplies the good, we can make a good bread
thin, but with the ingredients of truth and sincerity, as recommended
Paulo.

And we can always learn to produce a good yeast, seeking it in words and
in the example of the one who is the Bread of Life, par excellence, our Master Jesus.

Thus acting, we will allow good to harm within us, adding the good
feelings and spreading them among those who coexist with us or that of us
can get around, somehow.

Let's think about it.
