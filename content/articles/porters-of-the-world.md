You have already realized the importance of those who receive the Spirits
newcomers to earth through the gates of reincarnation?

Yes, we talk about the professionals who deliver and hold the baby first
than her own mother.

There are beautiful and exciting cases told by these missionaries who
we could call it the doormen of the world.

One of them is Dr. Eliezer Berenstein's.

He says that when he was just a medical student and was preparing to
psychiatry, was tasked with serving a patient.

As soon as she entered the infirmary and introduced herself, she surprised him with a
Question:

Don't you ever smile?

That tied face is a sign of some trouble, said with relaxed air.

I'm fine, thank you. You must be in some trouble, so
I came to examine her, said the future psychiatrist, already lifting the sheet and the apron
that covered her.

Are you newly formed?

Why is that? He asked worried.

It's just that I'm naked, the door is open and I'm a nun.

Well, don't worry about it, Sister Magdalene insisted. I used to be a midwife
here in this hospital. I have lived with many doctors and know how to recognize a good
Professional.

You're going to be a great midwife.

The young doctor corrected her:

I'm not going to deliver, I'm going to be a psychiatrist, and now I'm going to give you a little snack.

Do you really have a remedy for me? The doctors have already deceived me, my
tumor has grown too much...

Doctor Berenstein says that the words and behavior of that nun the
turned inside out.

The next day, he took his beard, which made him look like Freud, and decided that
would be a midwife.

When she went to tell Sister Magdalene the news, she, with simplicity and
wisdom, continued to give him great lessons.

You have hands as much to say goodbye and to say hello.

And be very fond of the first delivery you do, because I will be the one who
I'll be coming back.

Doctor Berenstein says that some time after graduation made his first
Birth. Sister Magdalene had already died.

He says he cried more than the child, who was a girl and ended up getting
the name of Magdalene.

From that day forward he had no doubt that his mission was to be
parteiro. A doorman from the world, as Sister Magdalene said.

Every professional who performs his work, with seriousness and dedication, is a
collaborator of God.

Whether you're heating your hands on the crop or creating sophisticated systems of
computer science; cleaning wounds or building buildings; making the hygiene of the
streets or cultivating gardens, we are all important pieces of this great ship that
we call Earth, and whose administrator is God.
