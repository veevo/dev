Jesus had come down from The Mount where just now, Pedro, Thiago and João had
witnessed the phenomenon of transfiguration.

When they reached the crowd, a man approached Him, kneeling
before Him, and saying:

Lord, have mercy on my son, who is whimsical and suffers greatly; Because
often falls into the fire, and often in the water.

And i brought him to His disciples, and they couldn't cure him.

Bebethat Jesus answered him:

O incredulous and wicked generation! How long will I be with you, and even when
Will I suffer you? Bring mo here.

Then narrates the evangelist Matthew, that Jesus rebuked the evil Spirit that
was with him and the Spirit abandoned him.

The disciples approached Jesus, curious, and, in particular, his
Asked:

Why couldn't we cast out the evil Spirit?

To which the Master gave them:

Because of your little faith. Because, in truth, I say unto you, if you have faith
like a mustard grain, you will say to this hill: move from here to there, and there is of
Spend. And nothing will be impossible for you.

Jesus concludes the lesson, stating:

But this caste of demons is caste but by prayer and fasting.

                                   *   *   *

It is necessary to serenade the soul and preconceived ideas, and reflect deeply
on the proposal for fasting and prayer offered by the Rabbi.

Did Jesus, in proposing the act of fasting, was referring to stop feeding
Regularly?

Because that's how many understand to this day. So it's mister
that we look at the theme from this point.

The Master's proposition went far beyond the diet.

He brought the idea of moral abstinence, to refrain from all that we
leads to excesses.

He thus speaks of a fast of sick behavior. This is the only way
for the liberation of the deleterious influences of spiritual obsessives.

Prayer is paramount, for it binds us to the Creator, purifies our thoughts and
elevates mental tuning.

Together with it, the change of behavior, direction in the purposes of life is
fundamental.

Unhappy spirits bind to us through harmony with our miseries
Intimate.

If we stop cultivating such miseries, if we change the mental range, do not
there will be more compatibility in this psychic plug.

The deprivation of negative actions, evil desires should be fasting for
soul that desires to free itself from any inferior spiritual influence.

Reasoned faith and action in good protect us from everything.

There is nothing to fear when the hands are scented by the flowers of good that
we leave by the way.

There is nothing to fear when the heart is heated by the certainty that the laws
of God are perfect, and that divine presence is constant in our lives.

Faced with any difficulty we will face, let us remember the lesson of the
fasting and prayer. Let us remember this powerful medicine that we all
we have it.
