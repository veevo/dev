For some, problems and challenges are just small barriers, so
Transposed. However, for other people, they turn into gigantic
Walls.

And that's exactly when resilience comes in, this ability to
individual dealing with problems, overcoming obstacles, transforming trauma into
learning or resisting the pressure of adverse situations without going into an outbreak
Psychological.

The Maranhão lawyer Marlene, with a successful career in the Attorney's Office
public, an enviable financial condition, found herself pregnant by the third
Time.

At the age of forty, he received the news, given by the doctor himself, that his
daughter would be born with Down Syndrome and would not live beyond twelve years.

She felt rushed into a black hole. It seemed to be the end of the world, of his
World. She was unaware of the Syndrome and the following months
were mourning, pain and many questions.

Why me? What did I do wrong?

Marlene felt angry, was depressed, and finally decided to go to the fight. In
say of a clinical psychologist, she began to see that she could take a flower of
a stone.

The first step was to clarify what Down Syndrome was.

And to offer her daughter better conditions, he left her homeland,
requiring locality to offer every possible opportunity for
your daughter could develop.

And Mayara was born. Today, at the age of twenty-eight, he's happy. It works, dating. Have
a normal life.

But more than overcoming the initial trauma and providing the daughter with the best
conditions for its development, by emparating it at all stages, Marlene
chose to assist others.

Today, she is president of the Reviver Down Association, a non-profit entity
that brings together parents and people with Down Syndrome.

There, she shares her experience with parents of disabled people.

Overcoming the issue that once reached her, Marlene demonstrated the importance of
resilience to the challenge.

And given the purpose of helping other people not need to pass
by his same traumas and pavors, he is dedicated to passing on his experience,
multiplying benefits.

A story of courage. A story of overcoming and love that demonstrates that
the human being is always stronger than you think.

And that, after all, no one receives greater burden than they can bear their shoulders.
God is wise and knows the fortitude of each of his children.

Why don't we always win? Because sometimes we exactly fail to
trigger these internal levers, our moral strength.

Because we allow ourselves to influence those who tell us that they do not
we'll be able to win.

Let's think about it and follow the examples of overcoming.
