There is an interesting evangelical passage in which Jesus recommends that man
reconcile as soon as possible with your opponent.

Reconciliation must take place while both are on their way, so that a
not hand over the other to the judge.

Because the judge can give the culprit to the minister of justice, who will put him
in prison.

If this occurs, the cells will not open until the last ceitil is paid.

These are strong images, which draw attention to the importance of
balanced coexistence.

Life on Earth is a fruitful and important school.

Spirits of diverse personalities and values are placed side by side.

The result should be the learning and growth of all involved.

Coexistence is not always easy.

In social life, there are usually any uncertain ones.

Ideas and objectives are often different, even among people of good
Will.

It is commonly stated that living between certain individuals is difficult by
be spiritual enemies.

In this line, they would have a common past of errors justifying the animosity
This.

That hypothesis is sometimes true.

However, in general, today's disagreements stem more from imperfections
and vices than of real intimate past.

Vanity, pride and selfishness account for the vast majority of the world's quarrels.

No matter the past, generous and humble beings always find a way of
living in a respectful and peaceful way.

The problem is not yesterday, but today that can unfold tomorrow.

It is important to adopt dignified and fraternal behavior, to go free.

Divine law is perfect and takes care of everyone.

She is never scammed, even in the tiniest ceitil.

But it is programmed for the progress and happiness of beings, not to punish and
infelicitar.

Hence comes the magnaimportance of Jesus' exhortation.

Imperfect beings make mistakes and stand at.

From the conflicts and divergent views, progress can arise.

However, limits are necessary in this process of divergence.

Life needs to be taken so that the heart does not renumber sorrows.

You're in a school, not a pitched battle.

The others are brothers, fellow son of a journey, although sometimes they think and act
in a different way.

Above all, you have to stay worthy and fraternal.

When the similar one errs, forgive him from the heart, without imposing conditions
Humiliating.

When you make a mistake, repent, apologize, repair and move on.

It is only not appropriate to expect the incidence of the Law, amid sorrows and vains.

Because that's where the great pains arise, destined to sweeten the heart that
made himself proud and resentful.

Think about it.
