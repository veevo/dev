Biblical tradition teaches that before the arrival of John the Baptist there was a great
prophetic silence.

For about four hundred years, no prophet has spoken to the people.

Finally, John the Baptist began to preach and caused great commotion.

Many even thought he was the long-awaited Savior.

However, when Jesus sought him to be baptized, John was emphatic in
point him as what would come.

At a later time, a crisis arose involving John's disciples, the
respect of the figure of Jesus.

The Baptist again did not title and stated clearly:

It is necessary for Him to grow up and i will decrease.

It is interesting to note that the famous prophet was not looking for a path
easy to follow.

He did not become inert, did not shy away from his testimonies.

He continued to preach with dismay, until his clear talk caused the
of the time decided to assassinate him.

But it did not fail to recognize the place that was due to it in the realization of
a superior ideal.

This posture of John the Baptist can give rise to healthy reflections.

Many creatures are willing to do good or work for an ideal.

However, they demand to occupy places of importance.

They want to serve, yes.

But as long as it gives them brilliance and recognition.

When you present someone more capable of performing a task
considered important, they are reluctant to give way to the place.

If a new leadership emerges, with great potential, they try to boycott it.

They are harshly critical of everything and everyone who can cast their shadow.

It's as if good can only be accomplished through them.

Such a type of conduct signals that the willingness to serve as a cause is greater
than the desire to serve it.

However, in the task of building a better world there is room for everyone.

The real reward for the love of beautiful and good is inner peace.

The recognition of the world is transitory and usually represents mainly a
burden to be borne.

It's not worth living on his own.

It is important to learn to serve, where and how necessary it is.

If the task requires some exposure, maintain modesty.

When the moment of brightness passes, stay in service, albeit in position
Simple.

I assimilate that good has no owner and that its realization is an achievement of the
Whole humanity.

Rejoice in the appearance of people with great potential and desirous of
Work.

Let them grow and rejoice even with their growth.

At the right time, knowing how to become obscure, so that a greater light shines,
for the benefit of all.
