In a certain passage of the Gospel, Jesus claims to be the scandals
necessary in the world, but Ai of whom provokes them.

In the vulgar sense of the term, scandal means noisy event, which causes
uproar or strepid.

In this line, the problem would reside not in the content of the conduct, but in its
Repercussion.

As long as bad action didn't generate fanfare, there would be no bigger problems.

It turns out that this sense values appearances and hypocrisy, in frank
disagreement with the lessons of Christ.

Jesus stated, in dealing with adultery, for example, that the mere thinking with
impurity was already reprehensible.

What will you say then of frankly nefarious actions, only committed in the deaf?

It seems possible to interpret the word scandal, in the evangelical sense, as
all that causes stumbling or embarrassment in the ways of one's own or others.

All that results from human vices and imperfections, everything that violates the
duties of purity and brotherhood, this is a scandal before divine laws.

But what's the reason the scandals are needed?

The crux of the issue lies in the still incipient evolution of the inhabitants of the Earth,
especially with regard to morals.

The planet, still for a while, will be the abode of rebellious spirits to the Laws
Divine.

More than due to the earth's material conditions, life here is
difficult because of our numerous vices.

Violence, corruption, promiscuity, all this generates unhappiness and disorders.

Many are the scandals produced daily by men, in their
Imperfection.

Except for the case of missionary souls, the Spirits rooted on earth have
affinity of feelings and values, to a greater and lesser degree.

Reciprocal contact of vicious creatures has varied effects.

It causes inevitable suffering by the continued shock of interests.

It is tiring to defend one's daily evil from others and to live with
cleverness and disloyalty.

This contact also provides the correctness of cosmic debts.

In the long learning process of life, the Spirit makes misconceptions that
need to repair.

He needs to get himself right with his conscience in order to qualify for
upper stages of immortal life.

You also need to gain patience and generosity and that is only achieved
before faulty creatures.

After all, angels do not challenge anyone's patience and do not need
favors or leniency.

Finally, contact with addiction causes men to slowly disengage
Him.

The spectacle of human rascals is sad. Over time, it makes
the ideal of different experiences, full of purity and compassion, emerge.

Thus, in the even lower stages of moral life, the scandal is unfortunately
Necessary.

But there of the scandalous, for he responds for all the evil he causes, even if he
the good arises indirectly.

When men debug themselves, the scandal will become unnecessary and
Disappear.

Any successes with cosmic justice will be in the form of effective
work in good, to embody the love that covers the multitude of sins, in the
say evangelical.

Thus, in order to achieve the release of painful injunctions, take care not to cause
Scandal.

If anyone does evil to you, know that the real harm is the scandalous.

He defies divine laws and unleashes serious consequences in life itself.

As for you, forgive and move on.
