The time of Christ

For those who live on Earth in these times of planetary transition, many have
been the fears, the frighteningness to surround us.

Looking at the earth's panorama, we found that there are two times: the time of the
world and the time of Christ.

In the time of the world we have the news of people able to promote evil,
moral misery, aggression.

At the same time, we record the existence of good business dealings working in the
sense of supporting, guiding and instructing happiness.

We can consider them managers of the workshops of love that the Creator has installed in the
most varied points on the planet.

These live the time of Christ.

We will also observe a large wave of people who trumpet pessimism,
disbelief, self-devaluation and self-destruction. Everything is bad: the government,
school, diplomacy between countries, people.

However, we will also see many people who foster common sense, the
respect for life, proclaiming the ideas that man is the builder of his
happy or unhappy journey. He's the world's chief painting promoter.

We will find scientists architecting perfect weapons and processes of
destruction, bombs and smart missiles, commanded by computers
Impeccable.

But those who find themselves living the time of Christ are involved in
develop saving techniques for his brothers. They are the ones who elaborate
blessed vaccines; those who create instruments to inspect the body
detecting diseases so that they can be treated urgently.

Others are immersed in laboratory research to discover
medicines or to ease the pains of the sick.

Those who live in the time of the world, scream in favor of abortion practices, in the
to destroy life before it flourishes. Some do it for reasons
merely political-economic, others in the name of medical-sociological issues.

However, enlightened souls extend their action, offering support, shelter to
women who were abandoned in the middle of pregnancy. In the name of love, they inspire
mothers thinking about the seed of life that pulses them in the womb.

And they suggest varied options so that no one needs to blood-stain the
own hands. Like adoption, for example.

We find, in the world, young people who engage in alcoholism, considered
innocent, or in drugs of serious consequences.

All in the name of ignorance and rebellion. And what they get is death
due to body wear.

They fenecem like flowers that did not wait for the season to bear fruit.

We identify, on the other hand, the young people who value the body. Who take care of the
food, which remain far from any exciting.

Young people who study, who wish to progress, work, serve the country and
World.

Young people who have dreams of moral greatness. Young people who make a difference in the world.

These are the days we live in. It is up to us to decide whether we want to be with the
times of the world or with the times of Christ.

Let us think about it and embrace the time of Christ, for our own
Happiness.
