She woke up crazy! That's what everyone said, at dawn that day, in the
city of Magdala.

Everyone wanted to know what had happened to Mary Magdalene who made her leave
all his wealth and comfort to get out of Magdala wearing just a simple
Mantle.

*   *   *

The night was dark and slightly cold.

As you approach the simple fisherman's house, on capernaum beach and in which
she knew the Master was, her heart went off and his hands became shaky.

Although her soul deeply desired that encounter, she felt
ashamed for her past acts, for her life of lust and imbalance in the
affective field.

As she entered the enclosure and contemplated him, in an impulse she threw herself at His feet, and,
midst of thick tears, he exclaimed, Raboni, who, in Aramaic, means
Master dear.

Jesus, taking the hands of that woman among his own, kindly assailed:
Maria.

She surprised him to call her by name, for they were getting to know each other
at that moment.

But Jesus redargui: Mary, I am the good shepherd. And I know all my
Sheep.

At that moment, the Master spoke to Mary about the treasures of heaven and invited her
to a great task: Love, Mary.

Feeling reborn, Mary Magdalene returned to her residence, sold her
goods, all distributing between their servants and the poor.

From that day, where Jesus of Nazareth was, there was also the
sorry of Magdala.

Time has followed. The day came when Jesus was taken before the authority
roman, imprisoned, tortured and crucified.

Along the way to Golgotha, alongside Mary, mother of Christ, was
Mary magdalene. His heart was shattered with sadness by what men
they made him who had been the only man who had truly loved her and
i'd accepted.

Three days had passed since He died. On Sunday morning, Maria de
Magdala went to the site of Jesus' grave. To his surprise, the tomb was
Empty.

Before I could understand what had happened, that sweet voice plus a
instead called her by name: Mary.

And with her heart filled with joy, she again threw herself at His feet: Raboni
!

In the years that followed, Mary of Magdala went to live together with the abandoned in the
valley of the lepers in Jerusalem, offering them the teachings of the Master.

On his return to the spiritual plane, he was received by Jesus, who, embracing her,
declared: Mary, have you passed the narrow door!... You loved it a lot! Comes! I
I hope here!

*   *   *

Let us keep Peter's words: Love covers a multitude of sins and mistakes.
Let's leave yesterday in the past and worry about what we do today in function
of our progress.

Every day God grants us a new dawn, full of opportunities.
Let us therefore take advantage of every second in order to march towards the Master.

Let's be sure: He knows us by name and awaits us with arms
abertos...
