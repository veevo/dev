Jesus had delivered the wonderful Sermon on the Mountain just one day ago.
phrases echoed in the air, and those who heard Him still experienced the vibrations
- mercy
special so on that moment.

In Capernaum, a noble man named Bartholomew became an siege of Jesus. The beautiful
words uttered meant to him a true status of conduct, and
he sought the Master with great doubt.

I wanted to know what the worst opponents of the human being. Asked when if
break the battle against these enemies and which weapons to be used.

Jesus, full of compassion, replied, I will tell you that these enemies
find within each one, and there they work for the misfortune of being.

All individuals point these enemies out of themselves, assuming that the
afflictions come from outside, from other people, and then become rebellious and
Vengeful.

The most merciless of all enemies is selfishness, devouring joys
Others. There is also avarice, envy, malevolence, hatred, jealousy,
unmeasured ambition, resentment.

And concluded: The fight to beat these enemies must be fought in the field of
consciousness, transforming inferior trends, adopting a rich conduct
in mercy, compassion, fraternity and charity.

Nothing else needed to be said. Bartholomew understood what the great
opponents of the human being, and how they could be fought.

After more than two thousand years, the Master's words remain as current as
Once.

Many of us still have a habit of holding the outside world accountable for great
part of what happens wrong, with you or others, without stopping to analyze
the real causes.

We judge armed conflicts from the perspective that seems most appropriate to us, taking
this or that party.

However, we hardly ever stopped to think that the same hatred, the same greed,
the same resentment that led to this conflict often lives in us, with
different causes and consequences, but with the same passion.

We talk about urban violence, and we always have a solution for it. But
we forget that our indifference generates the need, and even the hatred of the one who
Steals.

We talked about corruption, as if it were exclusive to those who hold the
Power. But we forget that the unmeasured ambition that generates it often lives
within us, even if in smaller proportions.

We comment on families undone by selfishness, and we think that our own
selfishness is justifiable because, after all, we have our needs.

We almost always postpone the beginning of voluntary work, with the excuse of
have no time, and we forget to develop charity in us, the
fraternity, compassion, real love for others.

Our worst enemies are in ourselves, as Jesus said, and it is time to
let us recognize them. Only then can we fight our personal battle against
them, in which the main weapon is love.

The Sermon on the Mountain is a true call made by Jesus who, since
so he patiently expects us to listen to Him.

What about you? Have you ever heard him? Have you read those beautiful words carefully? Already
opened his ears and heart in search of the only victory that really matters:
victory over ourselves and our moral imperfections?

Think about it.
