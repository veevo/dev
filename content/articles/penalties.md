When i were little, my sister and I were very dreamy. The dream and
imagination combined very well.

And from time to time, we made up stories about our companions. These
stories turned into rumors that, in a small town, ended by
cause displeasure.

In fact, we didn't do it for bad, but naturally, while we were
reins loose to our fantasy, unpleasant incidents multiplied.

I remember very well one morning before winter comes. It winded a lot and
we used to play in the shed. Meanwhile Mom was sitting on a stool, while
open, right in the middle of the yard.

It intrigued us a little, but soon we got distracted.

Our attention was awakened again when she called us, asking that
we took her a pillow and scissors, which were near us.

When we put the two objects next to her, she asked us to cut the
cushion in half.

Obey. The cushion was full of feathers and soon after, carried by the
wind, they filled the yard in a spectacle as beautiful as a storm of
Snow. My sister and I were delighted with the show.

However, Mom called us again. Next to her was her sewing basket,
that we hadn't even seen. It was from inside that she took out a cushion cover
new and empty.

She asked us to fill the pillow again. We were amazed at the
request, deeming it impossible for it to be met, for the feathers had flown by
all part of it.

As she watched her feathers dancing in the wind, she made a comment that I and I
my sister we haven't been able to forget all my life.

She compared the feathers to the rumors that certain people spread: once
scattered, there is no means of making them return to the starting point.

                                    *  *  *

This simple story leads us to reflect how important it is to take care of
any comment we may come to make about other people.

Let us always keep an eye on our words, not giving ourselves to malevolence.

Few of us cultivate indulgence, a fraternal feeling that moves us to
not see the flaws and defects of others.

When we notice the weaknesses of those of us, avoid spreading them or having the
be careful to mitigate them as much as possible.

We judge with severity only our own actions, because we all have
defects to be corrected and habits to be modified, and we often commit serious
Faults.

Being indulgent with the weaknesses of the other is a way of practicing charity.

The true character of charity is modesty and humility, which consist of
see each one only superficially the defects of others and strive to
to make what is in it good and virtuous prevail.

                                    *  *  *

Let us always reflect whether what comes to your ear is absolutely true to
be passed on. Let's think about what we're going to comment on, we'd also like you to
people would say about us.

Let us look at whether it is really necessary to talk about this or that fact, if it will bring
benefit or if it won't harm anyone.

Before we give in to the impulse to pass on any comment, let us remember
always from the feathers loose in the wind, as if they were our words that, of
no way, we can recollect.
