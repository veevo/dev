We know that it is in the family that is the basis of character building and also the
education of the feelings of the child and the young.

The home is, par excellence, a great and blessed school, a human institution
in which we learn to love parents, children and brothers to, one day,
to broaden this love to all humanity.

The family is the opportunity, granted by God, of readjustments of the past and
consolidation of affection.

The education process is relative because, at the same time that fathers and mothers are
educating their children, are also growing individually.

Child naivety facilitates the task of character modeling and
appropriate direction of bad trends.

It is then in adolescence that great difficulties usually arise. It's in this
phase that the young man is seeking to build his own identity,
easily establishing a conflict between generations.

Different world views can be one of the causes of this conflict. Healthy
understand that diversity of opinions is necessary for advancement and we seek
not make these differences cause for discord.

They become a cause for shock when the parties involved, parents and
young people, especially older people, try to impose their worldview.

In order not to occur such an imposition, by either party, there must be a lot of
dialogue, relationships, aiming at the construction of a new vision and the
learning that the point of view of the other must be respected.

Another issue that leads to these divergences is the difference in values and
interests between generations.

It is true that there are values that are perennial and should be part of the construction of the
character of good people. Honesty, respect, learning an occupation
useful, ethical and personal effort are unquestionable acquisitions.

However, if we remain crystallized in our own experiences,
we tend to transfer them to our children, not making room for them to
develop their own interests.

The type of education received by parents can collaborate in this process. Oppression
and intolerance processes generally do not cause positive results.
Flexibility is required at certain times.

Care should also be taken care of excessive permissiveness.

In the search for a new definition for himself, the young man begins to present
characteristics that we used to know, many of which we preferred that they
not have them, but we have to learn to respect them.

It is essential to differentiate what is specific to the individual's personality,
like tastes and preferences, and what needs to be shaped and oriented.

In order for us to establish a
encounter between them, it is important to cultivate deep respect between parents and
Children.

It is also essential that dialogue is always present and that the concessions
occur when necessary.

But above all, what must prevail is love, translated into the expression of
care and affection.

Let's think about it.
