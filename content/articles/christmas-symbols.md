Christmas, which we celebrate each year, presents some little aspects
Known. Especially with regard to their symbols.

For example, the Christmas tree. Some believe it originated in the Century
VIII. It would have been the missionary Saint Boniface who conceived her, in place of
to the worship carried out in the forests to the god Odin.

Others claim that martin luther was his creator in the 16th century.

Records the Story that, on Christmas Eve, Luther walked through a forest
pine trees. Looking up at the sky, he saw the stars shining even more beautiful
through the snow-covered branches.

Delighted with the beauty of the painting, cut a branch, took him home and used
candles lit to mimic the brilliance of the stars he had witnessed.

The Christmas tree came to America, in colonial times, brought by the
Germans.

The nativity scene, in turn, originated in the 13th century. It was in Italy. On the night of
December 24 to 25, 1224, Francisco de Assis had the idea of representing
the birth of Christ.

He prepared a staging, in a true stable, of manger, ox and
Ass. At regular times he himself appeared on the scene and spoke about the
birth of Jesus.

Also in the 13th century, the representation conceived by the founder of the
Franciscans became known throughout Europe.

Christmas cards appeared in England around 1843. The initiative was
director of the British Museum of London, Sir Henry Cole. They were popularized and
began to be printed in 1851.

Giving gifts is a tradition that originates in times indented times. It was part of the
saturnalias, festivals of Rome, as well as Nordic festivities.

Among Christians, the custom began in the 7th century, with Pope Boniface, who
gifted those in need in the name of the Divine Birthday boy.

The candles lit at Christmas to adorn the trees and other arrangements originate
common: the fire cult.

Only time made the pagan disappear and helped erase the memories
upon the origin of the fire, which was the old cult of the sun.

Since the symbols do not go back to the time of Christ, it is concluded that He, in
essence, has nothing to do with any of them.

So celebrating Christmas allows us to ornament the home with lights, colors,
Ornaments. But it's important not to forget to prepare the heart.

Prepare Christmas dinner for relatives and friends, but do not forget, in name
of the Divine Birthday, to satisfy the hunger of those who suffer it.

                                   *   *   *

Did you know that in 1870, during the war between Germany and France, a
Prussian official idealized Christmas cards from covers of some
high school notebooks?

He distributed it to his soldiers so they could write to their relatives.

You can imagine the emotion of a mother, a wife, girlfriend, brothers
getting a Christmas message, written of his own fist, by his love, of a
battle front?
