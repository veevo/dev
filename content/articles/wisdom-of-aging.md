He's a man over eighty. Strong. Those good Italians.

An example of knowing how to grow old. He has realized a long time ago that the
strength of youth has left him.

But that doesn't mean it got settled. Do everything the body still gives you
Allows.

Until recently, he drove his car and, at certain times, took care of the
wife, Inté said to her children and grandchildren and went on a trip.

At a time, a different location.

Are we going to know this place? - I asked his wife, whose age is about his.

I mean, I asked to ask, because you, also willing, always
Agree.

They closed the apartment and there they went to a resort, a water station, a
farm hotel.

Earlier, they completed their golden wedding and their children promoted a great deal of
Party.

He appeared in the most beautiful and lined suit, trimmed whiskers, white hair
well-combed and seriousness, disguising emotion.

She, in a beautiful long dress, turquoise blue, delighting his eyes, as if
were the first years of coexistence.

Recently, friends of Ideal Spiritist decided to pay tribute to him,
years of dedication to the cause. For its pioneering, raising the flag of
Spiritist Doctrine in lands where it just emerged, shy.

Immediately, your memory and ethics have been activated.

Why me? Before me, there were those who did a lot more than I did. And better.

And he remembered his friend, for whose hands he knew the Spiritist Doctrine. And it was
gift for the delivery of the tribute. Of course, he was also honored.

Thrilled, thanked, saying he did not deserve because, he said, of the Spiritist Doctrine
had received the best. He was therefore a debtor.

And, he encouraged youth, to the current workers to continue in the blessed
labor of disclosure, spreading lights, clarifying minds and hearts.

He moved everyone.

Simple, though possessing considerable assets and possessions, embraces vigorously
friends.

It makes a point of good talk, although the difficulty sometimes to hear. But
he adjusts his device for deafness and participates.

You're not ashamed to ask again when you don't understand.

Wise, don't talk if you're not sure you understood the question.

You know how to shut up when many talk at the same time, making it difficult for you to capture
of words.

It still holds an air of naughty sometimes showing that the children's viço does not
died in his intimacy.

So the other day, in the middle of breakfast with friends, when everyone had already
finished the meal and entertained each other at the table, talking, he took from a
knife and introduced it into the jar of milk candy.

I brought it with the loaded tip of the precious candy. He looked at his wife,
exactly as a child who knows that what he's going to do is wrong, and licked her,
with pleasure.

They all laughed. So is he. I had just made a very peraltice of itself of
Child.

But after all, when we age wisely, that's the way it is.

Mature in acting, young people in thinking, children for the pleasure of living intensely
every day.

                                   *   *   *

Frivolous people, who only value the outside, fear aging.

Thoughtful people age smiling. You know that the strength of youth is
passenger and take advantage of the toughness of the years to sow wisdom and harvest
venturas.

Perhaps for having educated children for good and love. For cultivating the
affection in marriage. For having built solid friendships, independent of
age, race, color, social level.

Let's learn from someone who knows how to grow old!
