Among the peoples we say deistic, it is common to hear expressions that
refer to God.

Some people have the name of God for any reason. Or for no reason at all.

Others say that using God's sacred name, for any reason, is a
great lack of respect for the Father of life.

Of course, each one defends his idea, full of reasons, of explanations.
As if it were a fundamental issue for the life of society.

Except for the name of God, we have the use of profanity, expressions of
low slang, which soak souls with negative, heavy vibrations.

From another band, the urges of the tormented soul, the untied revolts of the
intimacy of each, who present themselves in the coexistence of many, tend to
show through the 
Pornography.

Let us agree that, observing one and the other situation, much better will be that the
people get used to talking about God.

Any commentary on the Creator of the Worlds will bring waves of harmony
for those who express it. And also for those around.

A simple interjection, expressed in a syllable, in a popular gesture about the
Creator Father, you will always be welcome.

The impact that God's vibration imposes brings with it positive and good fluids
for the existence of all of us.

Thus, in the face of discussions around speaking in God or not using
His precious name is for each of us to choose to continue to speak of God. The
speak of God, speaking to project His name.

The issue of empty habits is not discussed. Of those who speak unspeak, without
repercussion on morale.

But that's a problem that shouldn't affect us.

Let us look at the heavens and remember the glory of God. Let us get out of the stars that
shone, singing God's excellence, and we pronounce His name in gratitude.

Let's open the windows in the morning, greeting the new day, extending the name of
God, who allows us to live another day on earth.

Let us embrace our children and remind them of the name of God, Providence Excelsa
that sustains our lives every day.

Write a message of optimism to someone and remember to invoke the name of
God, wishing you peace.

Let us pray in favour of those who suffer the pains of loneliness, detention, persecution
of men and let us remind him of the name of God, cause of all causes.

In the face of tormenting sufferings, let us speak in God, the explanation of all
explanations of all theses.

Taken by the music that leads us to special states of the soul, let us have in
the name of God, who created harmony, to the estesia.

Enchanted by the cadence of the verses of a poem, a poem; Grateful
by the light of our eyes, by the sound of our voice, by the vastness of riches
that involve us, let us speak of God.

Congratulated on the love of a husband, mother, brother, a friend,
thank God for the feeling that invades us.

Anyway, let us seek to tune God into our psyche, while
we experience the deepest emotions, the brightest feelings, the
happier theses.

                                   *   *   *

The name of God, whether spoken, written or thought, as soon as it is also felt,
prints in us immense joys, deep enlevos and sublime record of peace.
