Alice was bewildered, and finding a cat sitting on the branch of a
tree, asked him:

Could you tell me, please, what way to get out of here?

It depends a lot on where you want to go... - Answered the cat with a smile
enigmatic from ear to ear.

I don't care much where... - Alice said.

The feline sentenced: So no matter what path you choose. For whom
don't know where to go, any path serves.

                                   *   *   *

In these times of abundant information, of infinite possibilities, of
amazing technology, some care is needed.

Each day there is more and more talk about humanity's triumphant entry into the era of
Knowledge.

The human capacity to be living, from this moment on, a
period in which knowledge will be the first wealth.

Everything is a source for knowledge, and the main one is the internet.

That's where we need to slow things down.

Information should not be confused with knowledge.

The internet, among contemporary media, is the most fantastic and stupendous
information access tool.

However, turning information into knowledge requires, first of all,
criteria of choice and selection, as knowledge – unlike the
information – is not cumulative, but selective.

It would be like someone who gets into one of these great bookstores, not knowing very well
what you want.

You run the risk of panicking, having the feeling of intellectual debt, without
have clarity of where to start and imagining that you need to read all that.

The criterion is essential, that is, to know what is being sought, in order to be able to
depending on the purpose you have.

Computers and the internet have a tooling character that cannot be
Forgotten.

Tool has no purpose in itself. It is an instrument for something else, for
another end.

The criterion, balance will thus allow us to be able to use this
tooling wisely, at the right dosage at the right time.

Without selective criteria, many are suffocated by a precarious eagerness to read
everything, access everything, listen to everything, watch everything.

They forget to ask yourself: Do I want this for me? Do I need this? Why
Serves? Where do I want to go?

In today's times, if we are not very careful, we run the risk of navigating
on the internet, and sink.

Seneca, wisely, had said, that no wind is in favor, for those who do not
know where to go.

                                    *  *  *

David Hume said: Out of knowledge, I understand the certainty that is born of the
comparison of ideas.

For the idea to be born, it is necessary to think, compare, connect ideas.

No information can be taken by truth, by knowledge, before
mature within the human soul.

Wisdom is not transmitted. We need to find out ourselves after
a walk that no one can do in our place.
