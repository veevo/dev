Man is a gregarious being by nature.

He feels the need for conviviality and contact with the like.

Precisely for this, he establishes bonds throughout his life.

Many of these links are virtually automatic, such as those that stem from the
family structure.

However, some links originate only from affinity and sympathy.

Friendship is a very peculiar form of affection.

It is usually stated that friends are the family that has chosen.

The nobility of friendship was revealed by Christ himself.

In a certain passage of the Gospel, the Master stated that he no longer called the
Apostles of servants.

He called them friends, for He had made known what he had heard from the Father.

Jesus had offered His disciples what he best possessed: the light of His
teachings and the warmth of His affection.

That's what characterizes friendship: sharing the best of our being.

Nothing forces the maintenance of bonds of friendship.

It's the most fraternal expression of feelings.

It is sought to be close to the similar just for the pleasure of your company.

Because it is so precious, this bond must be well taken care of.

Winning friends can be easier than preserving them.

In the acquisition of affections, the personal charisma helps a lot.

But maintaining the bond requires dedication.

It is necessary to spend some time growing the affection that is
you've won.

It is really relevant to circumvent the very way of being, developing nobility and
Warmth.

Considering this reality, there are numerous attitudes that should be avoided in the
with friends.

Aggressiveness, in words or gestures, negatively surprises our affections.

Negligence, consistent with giving little importance to the presence and word of
partners, makes them no longer come to us.

Continuous irritation makes our company boring.

Constant lamentation also converts our presence into a heavy burden.

It is necessary to consider that others also have problems.

It is therefore important to cultivate joviality.

Hiding their own pains, not to inuselessly afflict the fellow, is a
form of charity.

Thus, ponder the importance of friends in your life.

Think about how they bring you joy and make your living lighter.

Remember the example of Christ, who gave the best of Himself to his companions who
Chose.

Don't spend the precious moments you spend with your friends on futility,
complaints or rascalities.

Give them their best.

Make your company a source of balance, joy and well-being.

Show yourself reliable and willing when they need you.

Love them, purityand disinterestedly.

After all, loyal and warm friends are one of the greatest treasures that can be
