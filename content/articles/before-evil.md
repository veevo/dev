The Law of Talião represented progress in the customs of humanity.

As a result of it, revenge has come to have limits.

Before, because of an offence, it was considered fair to decimate the whole family of the
Offender.

Then it became an eye for an eye and tooth for tooth.

That is, the evil that was reciprocated could not be greater than that received.

Jesus Christ came to bring the definitive contribution in this sand.

He said you shouldn't resist evil.

That if someone hit the right face, you had to offer the left, too.

That if someone took the garment, they might also leave the cape.

That if someone made him walk a mile, it was to hang out with him two.

They are strong words full of symbolism.

Certainly do not mean whether to allow aggression and violence to be
take over the Earth.

They are not an authorisation or incentive for the weak to become a beast
load of the forts.

Its deep meaning seems to be that only love is efficient in the
face with evil and evil.

The review, resentment and desire for revenge only prolong the
human imbalances.

Under the aegis of Christ, a new order of peace and generosity must be installed.

Jesus' disciple is peaceful and peacemaker.

He is meek, understanding, commanding and confident in Divine Justice.

Before an offense, in general three conducts are possible: to fight back, escape or
offer the other face.

The review implies the continuation of the struggle and imbalance.

The escape transfers the climate of hatred to future solution and denotes moral weakness,
that stimulates the violent.

The last alternative is undoubtedly the most difficult.

Faced with offense, offer the opposite face, that of forgiveness.

This act of greatness, consistent in the immediate understanding of the imbalance that
there in any bad act, destabilizes the aggressor.

Suddenly, he finds himself pitiful as he is, in the face of the serenity of the offended.

Violence tends to die asphyxiated in the cotton of peace that involves those who love.

It's impossible to beat someone with moral greatness.

In his face, every victory is apparent and gray-flavored.

Someone in peace and ready to let go of the blanket and the cape.

Who is patient and walks more than requested alongside those who impose it on him
effort.

It's certainly not easy to adopt this kind of conduct.

However, Jesus not only taught, but exemplified.

He was able to donate himself into a holocaust and His victorious proposal continues to transform
slowly humanity.

And it is from Him the invitation that resonates through the centuries:

If anyone wants to come after me, deny yourself, take your cross and follow me!
