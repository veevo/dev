Would you know how to define exactly what courage is?

Many perhaps answer this question by referencing impulsive acts,
thoughtless, and even violent who, not rarely, put someone's life
at risk.

Almost always this word is associated with impetuousness and aggressiveness in the
acts, which leads individuals to slip into precipitation, unable to
contain the urges of violence under the excuse of being courageous.   

But then what is the real meaning of this word?

A renowned dictionary of the Brazilian language defines courage as moral energy
difficult situations.

True courage brings balance in itself as the basis of all decisions,
of all feelings, of all attitudes.

It gives strength to endure all difficulties without defeatism; but with the
understanding of what is happening, and consequently with the possibility
to seek the best way to face any situation.

Who is brave brings in themselves the serene confidence in the resistances themselves, not
exposing unduly, nor if allowing inferior feelings of anger, or
the desire for revenge.

Having self-discipline requires courage. Self-discipline develops true
moral treasures that enrich the human being.

Courage is achieved in the succession of evolutionary experiences, between
difficulties and sufferings, through which resistance is acquired
moral and calm.

It is the moral strength of those who, being poor of material possessions, persevere
in the face of difficulties with resignation, without giving up.

It is the force that impels idealists who, with conviction, defend what
believe, and do not force others to believe in them.

It is necessary courage for the individual to remain human, behave with
appropriate manner, suffer with dignity, rejoice without exaggeration.

Courageous parents educate their children based on moral and ethical values.

Courageous children respect and love their parents, and do not allow themselves to be guided by fads
frivolidades.

Courageous families remain united, and their members support each other in the
difficulties, all of which are met with the successes of each one.

The courageous student values learning; the brave master doesn't give up
Never.

The courageous citizen loves his homeland and respects the laws in force.

The truly brave human being is not afraid to love. Yes, love everyone
as our dear Master Jesus to all recommended.

Nothing like the courage of Jesus who never abandoned His convictions, but who, in
no time used moral or physical violence to make him
believe or follow Him!

Nothing like the courage of Jesus who loved, understood and forgiven, even in the
moments of greater suffering!
