In the Sermon on the Mountain, Master Jesus said: Blessed are the poor of
Spirit, because of them is the kingdom of heaven.

Even today much is said about such a teaching, behalf that great interest
awakens in all who have become aware of Jesus' teachings.

However, such teaching, like so many others, remains ununderstood by the
Men.

What, after all, did the Master intend to proclaim?

Jesus proclaims that God wants rich spirits of love and poor of pride.

Rich spirits are those who accumulate treasures that are not confused
with the riches of the Earth.

Their goods are never corroded by moths, nor can they be subtracted
by the thieves.

The poor of spirit are those who are not proud. It is the humble, who do not
they're sick of what they know, and they never show what they have.

Modesty is your badge, because the true sages are those who have
idea of how much they don't know.

Therefore, humility is considered an indispensable requirement to achieve the
kingdom of heaven.

Without humility no virtue remains.

Humility is the driving force of all great actions, in all spheres of
man's performance.

The humble are simple in speaking.

They're sincere and frank in acting.

They do not make ostentation of knowing or holiness.

Humility, tolerant in its simplicity, sympathizes with those who intend to
confront her with her pride.

Shut up in the face of crazy words.

It supports injustice.

It vibrates with the truth.

Humility respects man not for his possessions, but for his real
Virtues.

The poverty of passions and vices is the one that must support the path that seeks
sincerely perfection.

This was the poverty that Jesus proclaimed: the poverty of low feelings,
represented by detachment from ephemeral glories, selfishness and pride.

There are many poor earthly goods who consider themselves worthy of the kingdom of heaven, but
who, however, have their soul hardened and proud.

They repudiate Jesus and close themselves in the strongholds of a faith that obscures his
understandings and keeps them away from the truth.

It is neither ignorance nor the misery that guarantees to beings happiness
promised by Jesus.

What directs us to such destiny are noble acts, based on charity
and unconditional love.

We also need to acquire knowledge that will enable us to extend the
in search of wider horizons.

Poor spirit are the simple and noble.

Not the proud and rogue.

Poor spirit are the good, who know how to love God and others, both
how much they love themselves.

They are those who observe and live the Laws of God. They study with humility.

They recognize how much they don't know yet. God implores the necessary support for
their souls.

It was about these men that the Nazarene Master, in His beatitudes,
was referring.

Many are those who confuse humility with servivilism.

Being humble does not mean accepting dismay and complaced with misconceptions.
To be humble is to recognize one's own limitations, seeking to overcome them, without
fanfare, no fantasies.

It is tirelessly seeking the truth and personal progress in the trails of the
noble and worthy examples.

Think about it.
