The ripe trigal looked like an immense sea curling to the taste of the wind that played
with the rods.

Soon again, it would be the harvest season and, wishing to show the son the beauty
the farmer called him to walk through the fields.

The little boy was extasianwith the landscape, always more beautiful and richer.

Attentive observer, from time to time he held a little more in some places.

After some time of walking, he asked his father:

My father, why are some wheat ears leaning to the ground,
while others are with their heads held high?

The farmer ducked down and harvested a spike. Just one of those that was
Curved. Showing it to her son, he explained:

Look, my son. This spike, which was tilted, almost touching the ground,
is perfect and full of grain. Observe that other, which rises with so much
pride of the trigal. It's dry and useless.

In our life, it happens too sometimes. Those who present pride
we are hollow, null, while the humble are valiator and useful.

Pride is an evil that usually generates ambition, which is the immoderate desire
of positions, honors, power, prominence.

Here's a great lesson, my son. Pride is never allowed. It's a great
evil and needs to be fought.

There are some rules that can help us contain our pride,
recognizing what we are, valuing ourselves, but never believing ourselves better
or superior to others.

First item is to seek self-knowledge. It is impossible to examine ourselves
sincerely and not recognize their own flaws.

Second, let us think about the insignificance and transition of all the things that
are a source of pride on Earth.

Riches, for example. They are not eternal and quickly transit
certain hands for others.

Wealthy families suffer financial collapses, while creatures that
seemed almost nothing to possess, stand out, reaching unimagined topics.

Not to mention that, with death, all property, titles, possessions, remain in the
Earth. Only virtues and passions follow with the Spirit, that is, the good that
we build and the evil we create for ourselves.

Third, let us recall the example of Jesus, a perfect model of humility.

He, the Solar King, our planetary Governor, came to us, lived with us,
indulging in carpenter's work.

And for his mission of love, he identified himself as the Shepherd, who takes care of the
Sheep. Largest of all of us, presented itself as the Server.

Finally, accept modest positions for performing anonymous tasks, which
many benefit.

                                   *   *   *

Let's follow our Model and Guide. Our passage through the Earth is transitory, as
all things in the world.

It is enough that great winds come forward to destroy what takes years to
Build. The storms, floods, merciless winter or drought
time agents over which we have no power.

Let us remember human frailty and that in order to live every day, we depend
providence and divine mercy.

Let's think about it and be less proud.
