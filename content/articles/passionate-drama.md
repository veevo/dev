Quando a conheci eu tinha apenas 16 anos. Ela, eu não sei. Fomos apresentados
numa festa por um rapaz que se dizia meu amigo.

It was attraction at first glance.

She drove me crazy. Our connection reached a point that we could no longer live
without her.

But it was a forbidden relationship. My parents wouldn't take it. I was reprimanded
at school and started sneaking her up.

But then it didn't work out. I went crazy. I wanted to, but I didn't have it. I couldn't
allow them to stay away from her. I always wanted her more.

On a day of uncontrollable, I hit the car, broke everything indoors and almost
I killed my sister.

I was crazy, desperate, I needed her...

I'm 39 today. I'm in a hospital, I'm useless and I'm going to die.
abandoned by my parents, friends and her.

Do you know what your name is?

Cocaine.

I owe her the loss of my youth, my life, my destruction and
my death...

This outburst is signed by a famous American singer who died there
years and was transcribed in the internal newspaper of a multinational company,
aiming to warn parents and children about the drama of people who become
drug addicts.

Today, the text circulates the Internet, and is dedicated to all young people,
in love with her or not, so that they meditate on this kind of obsession that
it doesn't lead to anything, it just destroys.

It is a warning to parents that it is necessary to fill the void that is installed in the
young people's hearts, so that they do not seek support in arms of false
friends, who can introduce them to drugs.

And when you talk about drugs, let's not imagine that danger is only in those
that are prohibited.

There is very young man delivering her health, youth, his dreams and his life to
these free poisons we know as cigarettes and alcohol.

They are socially accepted drugs, but that have led many of our young men to a
sinister end, under the passive eyes of parents and rulers.

How much is a young man's life worth after all?

Certainly not all money collected from marketing taxes
of these poisons is worth the life of a citizen.

But families need to wake up to this sad reality and take
urgent action.

It is worth crossing our arms and criticizing cigarette and cigarette factories
alcoholic beverages because, if there were no consumers, the products would not be
for sale.

What we have to do, as citizens aware of the need to change this
framework, is to act directly next to the root of the problem. And we're going to find her in the
intimacy of each home, where parents set an example and sustain the vices of
children, for not having, themselves, strength and courage enough to break with
their own vices.

May the vent of the singer, who lost everything to cocaine, serve as a warning to
we all, and that we can do something positive to help our young people not
go the same way.
