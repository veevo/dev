We are not always well accompanied, and one of these disturbing companies is the
that makes us unhappy to realize the happiness of the other.

Envy is not in the simple realization of the triumph of others. She introduces herself
when this finding harms us, produces in us negative feelings of
revolt, of indignation.

This daughter of pride settles in our soul and takes us to the precipices
morals of hatred for no reason.

Much easier than seeking our happiness, our own achievements are
criticize, question, destroy that of others.

Envy is moral laziness, it is accommodation of the Spirit that is not yet unclose
and willing to undertake the necessary fight for growth.

Instead of engaging in self-valorization, the patient of envy regrets the
triumph of others and does not fight for his. It often calls for intrigue and
malevolence, is awaiting the failure of the alleged adversary,
chasing him, seeking to satisfy his morbid pleasure.

Egocentric, did not leave psychological childhood and intends to be the only center of
attention, creditor of all cults and references.

Insidious, envy is the result of mental and moral indiscipline, which does not
considers life as a divine heritage for all.

He works, out of envy, to compete, stand out, stand out.
respect for people and their arduous achievements.

This sick feeling discharges harmful mental currents directed at its
victims, who only catch up with them if they are in tune. However, the damage
occur in those who generate this feeling, disturbing their activity, behavior.

So the envious will always lose. Not only will it not solve your problem
- if it exists - as it will always increase your frustration, your unhappiness.

The therapy for envy consists initially of the careful reflection of the
around its grand igrandiose destination in the future.

It is to evaluate the resources available to you and to consider that your reality
is unique, individual, and cannot be measured or compared with others on grounds of
the process of the evolution of each one.

The cultivation of joy, for what it is and the resources to reach new heights,
is the awakening of love to oneself, to others and to God.

This awakening will give the creature the perfect understanding of the mechanisms of the
life and differences between people, forming a holistic whole in the great
Unit.

Make your happiness and true treasure upon the earth in works of
charity and submission, the only ones that must contribute to the admitted beings
within God.

These works of good will make your joy and your happiness eternal.

Envy is one of the ugliest and saddest miseries of your globe.

Charity and the constant emission of faith will make all these evils disappear,
as men of good will multiply.
