The modern world is rich in possibilities.
Society lives best with differences and the most diverse options are
without causing great shocks and antagonisms.

In the past, it wasn't like that.
For a long time, the transposition between social classes was difficult, if not
Impossible.

In certain cultures, those who were born into a family of artisans should be so too.
The circle of nobility was inaccessible to the commoners born.
Today there is a greater degree a freedom not only of options, but also of
costumes.

Before the social body, it seems possible for the individual to freely choose
their profession, habits, housing and friends.

He can choose to constitute a family or stay single.
It is possible for someone to get married, to separate, to remarry countless times.
This context of freedom is valuable to human beings.

It is not possible to grow in understanding and understanding without the possibility of
make decisions and bear the consequences.

But it is necessary to reflect on the reflections of one's own options.
Humans are constantly interacting and the acts of ones reflect in the
lives of others.

Precisely for this is why it is stated that freedom presupposes responsibility.
For the Christian the issue of freedom is even more serious.

It needs to reconcile the options it makes with the words and examples of the
Christ.

Otherwise, the word 'Christian' will be only a label, devoid of
Meaning.

So, if you claim yourself to Be Christian, look at how you use your freedom.
Ponder whether your choices reveal fidelity to Jesus' lessons.

As you identify with Christian values, this means that your

sensitivity is awakened to transcendent aspects of life.
That is, the world and its values no longer fully satisfy it.

There is in you the need to transcend, to purely love your brothers,
understand and respect life.

Remember, therefore, that Jesus was work, love, renunciation and purity.
Are your options in accordance with this model?

If you're not, think you're free, full of possibilities.
Culture is accessible to you, careers are at your disposal, you can spend
your time as i wish you.

Why not freely opt for lasting happiness?

That it is important that in the world the dishonesty, lust and
Irresponsibility?

You are solely responsible for your options, for what you make of your life.
Do not use other people's misconceptions as excuses.

In a certain passage from one of his epistles, Paul de Tarsus states that
everything was possible for him, but not everything was convenient for him.
That's exactly your situation.

In today's world, almost everything is admitted, uncensored.
But the conscience of those who love and admire Christ does not compact with
frivolous behaviors.

Don't delude or dull your conscience.

Live your freedom noblely.
