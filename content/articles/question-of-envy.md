It is said that a firefly was on the eagerness to light his facho and erase it.
Interesting operation. The light shone for seconds and erased, so that soon more
shine again.

A snake, which was nearby, observed that light lighting up and
erasing and sneaking up to where the author of such a feat was.

When she was about to take the boat, it was perceived by the tiny insect,
who took flight and escaped being mouthed.

However, the snake slid quickly and was in his reach. And so
stayed: he flew and landed. She followed him and tried to light him up. Finally, the
firefly landed and said to his stalker:

Owner charges, stop a little. I want to ask you a question: can you tell me if, by
chance, do I belong to your food chain?

No, he said his sibilante, the reptile. And he prepared to attack him.

Wait a minute, ma'am. Tell me, by any chance, did I do you any harm?

No, you're talking about the snake again.

Tired and impatient, the firefly asked: Can you tell me, then, why is it
that you want to grab me?

Very simple, she said. It's just that you shine.

                                   *   *   *

The fable brings us to situations that are well known in the world. People who
they usually attract to themselves the envy of those around them.

And the envious only think of denigrating the image of those who stand out. Or
destroy your concept before others.

Thus, whoever is willing to perform good, becomes the target of slander because,
claim, no one can be so good without self-interest.

Those who stand out in the context of honesty find by the way those who sum up
his life, his minimal acts, to the cata of something that can demonstrate that, after all,
it's not as correct as it looks.

Malevolence is arm-in-arm with envy because what they both want is
destroy the good image, the life, the careerof those who have become their targets.

Envy is able to raise slander against worthy lives. With vague phrases,
hesitant, has the ability to defame the noblest character.

Therefore, the envious is an unfortunate burden in the economy of other people's happiness.

And yet it would be enough for you to change your posture. That is, in desiring for you
the spotlight that focuses on someone, could be willing to do what
that does, acting like that acts, whether in the field of science, art, good,
in general.

Because, however, you prefer not to make any effort, you choose the weapons that
possesses: the breast, anger, empty prosecution and sometimes reaches its
evil goals.

However, the envious remains misadventured in himself, soon finding another
to deliver their destructive darts.

                                   *   *   *

Let's examine our own conduct. If we find that we are in this
tortuous path, we modify the step.

Let us try to enlighten ourselves if we envy the brightness of others!

Let us strive to reach who, personal effort and dedication, is
steps above.

That way, we will feel happy for our own achievements. And, of course,
the world will be better because we will be another human being presenting good, the
beauty, the righteous.

Let's think about it. Let us do this because all of God's children were created to
light and for love.
