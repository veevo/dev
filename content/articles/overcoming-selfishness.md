Spiritual benefactors teach us that selfishness is the chaga that must
disappear from the face of the Earth. Because of selfishness our moral progress is
slow steps.

The selfish man thinks of himself and only himself. Everything you see, he notes, believes that
should serve you.

Denial of charity, selfishness generates insecurity for men, because as the
selfishness and pride go hand in hand, life will always be a race in which
you'll beat the smartest. A struggle of interests, in which nothing, nor does anyone deserve
Respect.

It is observed, again and again, in the crowded collectives, the race for a bank
to sit down. No elderly with difficulty of balance are respected, who are
simply pushed. They don't respect themselves disabled, in their difficult march,
women with children on their lap.

What matters is that the selfish is comfortably accommodated.

From this small daily sample we move to the panorama of the world, where nations
rich people contrast with the misérrimas, with the people starving.

This reminds us of a great famine that has befallen a European country, in
certain time.

The poor, and especially the children suffered a lot.

A wealthy man called twenty children and told them that every day he
he would attend the square with a basket with a bread for each of them. A bread per
day is what they would receive, until hunger was extinguished in the country.

The starving children set off at the basket and fought, each
wanting the bigger bread.

After the battle, each of which ran with his trump card: the bread to kill
hunger.

They're all gone, except for a little girl. In the distance, he stared at the man.
He arrived slowly, took the last and smallest bread left in the basket, thanked him,
smiled and left.

The next day, the kids came back. The jerks and tapas disputed the breads
Larger.

For the little one left a small bun, not half the size of the others.

When, upon arriving home, his mother opened the little bread, found six coins
silver.

The girl ran to return them to the good man who said to her: They're yours. Right
Mistake. I had the coins put the coins in the smallest bread to reward you.

And concluded the lesson: Remember that people who prefer the smallest piece to
dispute, selfishly and aggressively, for the most part, they will find blessings
much bigger than money on your way.

There are many lonely souls simply because they do not solve the
busting the bonds of selfishness to be useful to someone.

Selfishness can be regarded as a useless old clothing that is preserved in the
pride home.

The best antidote to the evil of selfishness is knowledge of spiritual life.
