Quando o assunto é doença, todos temos uma história para relatar. Não existe
quem não a conheça, por si mesmo, ou através da experiência dos amigos,
parentes, familiares, colegas.

Some fear it and do not even wish to pronounce the word, as if such a fact
could attract the disease.

The one that is most talked about is the diseases of the body. We talked about
infections, contagions, epidemics, physical trauma, accidents.

We also mentioned the various diseases of the mind, in its context of phenomena
psychological and psychiatric disorders, which present themselves as dissatisfactions, misfits,
conflicts, alienations.

However, we forget the diseases of the Spirit. We have heard haunting accounts of
bitter pain and remain indifferent. We know of children separated from their
parents, from little ones handed over to hard work for their young age and this
does not sensitize us.

The illness of wickedness that leads us to architect plans for revenge,
spreading pain and hopelessness.

The disease of hatred that consumes us the more we do the more we provide you with
fuel, making us beings destroying the peace of our sowing, sowing slander,
defamations, poisoning people against each other.

Sickness of jealousy that congratulates us the hours and makes us unbearable to
those whom we claim to love in total.

It is the lack of purpose applied to the existence that creates idleness, which
promotes evil, which makes us spend time inappropriately. No ideals to
persecute there are no noble actions to accomplish and the hours pass slowly, without
have something profitable that fills them.

Sickness of pride that makes us believe that we are better than others,
that no one more than we deserve happiness, the compensations of life, all
i'm glad you can imagine. Carriers of such a virus, we despise affections,
we forget the gratitude and how much we need each other to live.

All the infirmities of the Spirit, in short, lead us to forget and
disregard human and divine laws.

And it would be so easy to end all these diseases. It would be enough for us to put in
our will and eliminate from the map of our behaviors the
selfishness, anger, fear, hatred, anxiety.

Knowledge and respect for life-functioning mechanisms alter the
our way of being and provide us with real health, the one that emanates from the
Spirit to the body, reflecting our outer harmony.

Jesus never got sick. Master par excellence, His life was of love and for the
Love.

With His acts and words he demonstrated the greatness of true health
inviting us to overcome our inferior passions and become
similar to the Father who created us, pursuing perfection.
