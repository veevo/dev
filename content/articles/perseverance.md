Whoever stopped to observe a child trying to figure out how
something works, or in trying to run something you want, you should already
know what perseverance is.

Perseverance is this virtue that leads to perfection. A virtue that seems innate
babies and in the early years, disappearing afterwards, when men begin
to grow and come to believe that the most important thing in the world is to make many
things, no matter what way.

Some parents instill this way of thinking about their little ones, when they put them
in multiple activities and they need to run from one class to another, and do
all in a hurry, to realize the message.

Possibly, this is one of the reasons many give up, in the midst of
way, when they wish to do something. It's common to hear people talk
abandoned projects because difficulties appeared.

Let go of that and opt for something easier, less laborious and whose
result is almost immediate.

This reminds us of a moving experience of a Japanese artist. He
called Hokusai and his paintings were highly coveted by royalty.

One day, a nobleman visited him and commissioned a painting of his precious bird.
He left the bird with Hokusai, and the artist told the nobleman that
return a week later.

Because he liked the bird very much, the nobleman was anxious and, over the weekend,
returned to the artist's studio. However, the picture had not been made.

The artist humbly asked him to return after two weeks. The two
weeks turned into two months in six months.

A year later, the nobleman arrived at Hokusai's studio, demanding the painting of
immediate and his bird back. According to Japanese custom, Hokusai
bowed before the nobleman and returned to his work desk. Took a brush, a
large sheet of rice straw paper and, in a few moments, drew the
bird, without any effort, exactly as it was.

The bird owner marveled at the painting for, soon in
then unload your anger:

Why did you make me wait a year if you could have arranged the painting in such a
little time?

You don't understand, the artist said softly.

And he invited the nobleman to enter a room, where the walls were covered with
paintings of the same bird. None of them, however, expressed grace and
beauty of the last job.

He had trained for a year and his effort was rewarded: he had created a
artwork.

                                   *   *   *

When you are about to give up a dream, a plan, a
activity, remember the Japanese artist and his perseverance until he reaches the
Perfection.

Child record trying to turn a key in closet lock by
first time and, sitting on the floor, or on his knees, tries, tries and tries. And if
today fails, he goes away, to return afterwards and try again, and
another one more.

Finally, remember that you are in the world to perform a work of art: the
your life. And don't measure your efforts, you don't care about the repetitions. It is the
drafts that give perfection to the final work.
