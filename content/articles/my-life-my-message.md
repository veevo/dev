When taking stock of its existence, and be asked about what message
would leave for India, the great Mohandas Gandhi said: My life is mine
Message.

The great pacifist chose no words, did not choose lessons, did not choose
Formulas. You left your example, your steps, your life.

The examples are stronger than saying, they are stronger than written and
than recipes.

When someone is able to live his own message, he becomes messenger and
message at the same time. It becomes strength and fortress simultaneously.

Leaving life as a message is to follow the path of consciousness in peace that, at the
end of the day, safely, without any subterfuge, can say that it should not
to no one.

Life as a message still goes beyond duty. It also reaches the sphere
of the statement: I did everything in my power.

The action is necessary for us to grow. It's not enough not to do wrong. Right
need to do good, love, trim edges, strengthen ties, emit light to
all sides.

Fathers and mothers should make every effort to be live messages for their
Children. That doesn't require perfection, because it's not within our reach yet. Requires
only attention to the steps, seriousness in commitments, error observation,
so that they may learn from them.

People who have some visibility in the world, artists, politicians, leaders,
all of these need to be attentive to Gandhi's speech.

All brought the commitment to multitudes, for their actions, their words,
their way of living are copied by many.

Even in smaller spheres, sometimes we are a reference for many who perceive
our example, which notice our values, and will notice if what we say is
different from what we live.

If in all of Gandhi's work in South Africa and then in India, he had
if exalted once, had used violence in a single
opportunity, your whole message would be compromised.

However, this did not occur. He was able to take punches and suffer violence
without requiring review. He offered the other face in all
moments, remembering another great Master who also made His life His
Message.

Jesus, contrary to what many speak, did not die to save us. He lived
to give us the roadmap of salvation for our lives.

Yes, His example is the great script that left us, his great message, the
point of the man who wishes to turn into true agent of good if
self-inquiring on a daily basis:

What would Jesus do in my place? What would He do in this same situation?

The answers are not easy and simple, of course, but the question alone is
powerful, and it's halfway to the journey.

                                   *   *   *

Be the change you want to see in the world. " Said one day the great liberator
from India.

If we want to see the transformed world, let us start with us this change.

How are we doing? Better than yesterday? Ready for the New Age? Willing to be
good men?
