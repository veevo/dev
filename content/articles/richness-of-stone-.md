Rich parties become so poor, when wealth rests only on
noble coats of arms...

Sumptuous honors... Empty sumptuousities...

Absence halls, recklessness, lack...

Dance in the luminosity of their rough diamonds in the falsehood of their daring
short smiles...

How do you use your beauties, showy ladies?

Attracting bodies or feelings - flames?

How do you conquer your beauties, dear gentlemen?

Promises that inspire truths, or delight passengers?

Why do Chopin play if Chopin wasn't invited?

And even if i had received an invitation, i would have refused...

Why did they bring ropes, puffs, metals,

If your hearts don't listen to them anymore?

They heat up in the fire, but the fire can't see.

They bathe at night, but your sleep doesn't give her...

The spirit falls asleep under the effect of poisonous words.

Wake up in clover misadventures.

Don't you see that they dance in voids, and voids make you?

That without the pure source of water, the rivers, the rivers do not form?

For God's sake, listen to this invisible shadow that visits you.

As bright as it is, the richness of stone... you will never be rich.

                                   *   *   *

Allan Kardec asks the Spirits in The Book of Spirits:

What to think of the man looking for in the excesses of every kind, a refinement
for your pleasures?

Superior Spirituality offers the following answer:

Poor unhappy worthy of shame and not envy. you're very close to death!

Understanding that spirits spoke of physical death and morality, the Encoder
of Spiritism concludes:

The man looking for in the excesses of every kind a refinement of pleasures
falls below the animal, because the animal knows how to stop in the satisfaction of its
Need.

Despises man the reason God gave him by guide, and the greater his
excesses, more dominion exerts its primitive nature over its nature
Spiritual.

Diseases, decay, premature death from abuses are the
the transgression of the Divine Law.

The richness of the stone, really, will never be rich...
