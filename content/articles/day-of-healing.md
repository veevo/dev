Debbie was only sixteen when her English teacher kidnapped her
and took his life.

Her mother, Betty, became so depressed that she came to neglect her others
four children.

Day after day she cursed the killer. He had taken his breath out of life.
He had destroyed the life of a laughing teenager and who had plans for the
Future.

Nothing diminished your pain. Nor the absence of any obvious reason for that
terrible crime. Nor the teacher's sentence to life imprisonment.

Hatred consumed her. He started to have constant headaches and back pains.
After a while, I could barely stand up.

Six years passed long, sore. Until, at his sister's funeral, a
passage of Sunday prayer impressed her.

A phrase, about which he had never meditated: Just as we forgive those who
has offended.

She sought literature on forgiveness. Maybe I'd find an answer
for your life.

He went to visit Debbie's grave. For the first time he read carefully what was
engraved on the tombstone: What the world needs now is love.

Soon, Betty was repeating out loud, as if it were a mantra: I want to
Forgive.

Months later, he decided to write to the killer: I'm tired of feeling mad at you.
Can I visit him?

Eleven years after the death of her beloved daughter, she visited him in prison.

I told him what Debbie meant to her. How much she suffered. Both
they ended up crying.

When he left prison that day, he felt like a different person. your
heart was light.

She had thrown away the sorrow and anger that had consumed her so much in those long
and dragged years.

Friends, amazed, couldn't understand their attitude. Your answer
it was: Forgiveness was the greatest gift I gave to myself and my children.

She went on to work as a mediator in a program for victims of crime
Violent.

In peace with herself, he states that it was an incredible journey of healing that saved the
your life.

And the journey is called forgiveness.

                                   *   *   *

Forgiveness replaces hostile feelings that destroy physical organization, peace,
positive feelings that make the body calm down, relax, improving the
Health.

Clinging to a resentment for months or years means taking on a
commitment to anger.

Forgiveness can be a powerful antidote against anger. Who allows themselves to consume
anger makes dangerous links with chronic hypertension and has increased the
risk of heart disease.

In addition to bringing emotional benefits, purging anger can help heal
part of what physically afflicts us.

The simple fact of thinking about solving a heartache can already help.

It's worth forgiving! It's a matter of wishing for good for yourself.

                                   *   *   *

If we can't totally forgive, the fact that it's not boiling with anger,
nor planning revenge, it's a good start.

Anyway, forgiveness is powerful. Although it cannot change the past, the fact that
confront unsolved problems and the people behind them can drive
to a healthier and happier future.

Let's think about it!
