If someone threw a rock at you, what would you do to her?

You would gather it and guard you to shoot your attacker in a timely manner  
or would you throw it away?

Would you take care of her injuries and forget the stone where she fell?

If you answered that you would store it to return at an appropriate time, then
Think about how this stone will get in your way during the walk.

Let's assume you keep it in your shirt pocket, where it's pretty easy to catch it.
when you have to.

Now imagine how this stone will cause you a lot of discomfort.

First, because it will be a dead weight making it difficult for you to walk demanding greater
effort to keep her in place.

Second, because every time you go hug someone, you'll both feel that
strange object to hurt the chest.

Third, because if you win a flower, for example, you won't be able to put it in the
pocket since he will be busy with that useless weight.

Fourth, your aggressor may disappear from your life and you will never
more to find it again and in this case will have carried the stone uselessly.

Making now a comparison with an offense you may receive,
we can follow the same reasoning.

If you save the offense to fight back at a timely time, think about what it will be like
a useless weight overloading you.

Think about how much time you'll lose by mentalizing your aggressor and imagining plans
to get revenge.

Ponder how many times you will stop smiling at someone, thinking about
how it will return to offense.

And if you insist on feeding the idea of vevide, over time if
will make a person bitter and unhappy, for this acid stored in his intimacy
its brightness and vitality.

But if you think differently and when you get a stone it deals with the injuries and
throws the stone away, you will realize that this is a smart decision, for it will act of the
same way when receiving any other offense.

Whoever excuses your aggressor is truly a free person, for for forgiving is
break free.

Moreover, those seeking revenge match their aggressor and lose all reason
even if you're right.

Only one can consider themselves different who acts differently and not that
who wishes to do justice with his own hands.

In cases of aggressions that deserve action, we must seek the support of the
justice and leave the proper resources to it.

However, it is worth noting that forgiving is not just temporarily forgetting the
offenses, is to wipe the heart of any feeling of revenge or hurt.

The raw stone forgives the hands that hurt it, turning into a valuable statue.

The grain of wheat forgives the farmer who throws it to the soil, multiplying in
many grains that, crushed, enrich the table.

Iron is allowed to bend at high temperatures and forgivethose who model it,
building safety and comfort.

Forgiving, therefore, is imposing for every hour and every moment, for forgiveness
true is like a light flung in the direction of life and that will always return to the
source from where it came from.

Think about it!
