You may have already noticed, in the course of federal and state highways, one without
end of crosses scattered along the numerous kilometers that connect the tips
of our country.

In general, they point to a tragic event that occurred in that excerpt from the
road: a hit-and-run, a vehicle shock, a truck tipping,
the outcome of which is the death of one or more people.

They also record, in a simple way, the sadness, the sorrow of those who
suffer the longing for the physical absence of their loves.

Roads, so many miles... and so many crosses.

Silent, discreet... There's the memorial in respect of the memory of
Someone. For us, a stranger, but who was much loved for being a son,
daughter, husband, wife, father, mother.

Erected in the midst of haste, at speed, they rise in respect for longing,
memories, tears.

                                   *   *   *

How many crosses do we leave on the shores of our path?

How many tears we let run loose, how many buried regrets,
bitterness, disappointments, frustrations?

Jesus, the Nazarene Master, condemned: If anyone wants to follow me, deny themselves
even, take your cross and follow me.

Every cross we leave in our ways, even if they refer to the pains and
sufferings we have been through, help to count the steps we have taken to
get where we are and to be who we are.

The crosses left represent the death of an ancient self, so that we may
be reborn more experienced, wiser, more prepared for the new challenges.

In the Epistle to the Ephesians, we harvest: Renounce past life, strip yourselves of the
old man. Renew without ceasing the feeling of your soul and coat you from the
young man, created in the image of God, in true righteousness and holiness.

                                  *    *    *

For every cross on our journey, a farewell.

Although with tears, little by little we say goodbye to our pride, to our
malevolence, vanity, unlove, lack of charity and faith.

On every cross, gradually, we leave behind the old man, the old
habits, the old prejudices.

With each cross, like the Rabbi of Galilee, we deliver in the hands of the Father our
Spirit on the march, which leads towards truth, good and happiness.

The crosses along the highways represent only a brief goodbye, once
that life never ceases, fraternal bonds never fall apart and there is no doubt
on the reunion with our loves, in the other plane of existence.

Similarly, the crosses we leave in the course of our path represent
passing tears, pains that are not eternal, since the north of our
journey is happiness, good, peace.

                                  *    *   *

Let us take our crosses, our challenges, our fears, our
misfortunes and follow Christ.

The crosses on the margins of our journeys and the ones we carry are the challenges that
Divine Providence knows how to be able to overcome. From them we learn and
through them we renew ourselves.

Let's think about it! Trust!
