How to wait for the improvement of the world, if so little care exists towards the
children's heart?

How to hope for better times for humanity, in the short or medium
before this stark indifference to the childish soul?

How can one condemn the adolescent of antisocial customs when he became
almost a rule abandoning the child to his own luck?

How to think of a time of balance for society and peace for the world,
when the formation of the little ones is neglected so much, when news is being made
and images of wars in their minds without any mercy?

How to want a healthy childhood for the earth, in front of the grotesque scenes in
that sex in disarray and pornography dispute the attention of children, before
passive consent of parents and masters?

How to aspire for the age of harmony and brotherhood on the planet, if the struggles
encouraged cheating and instigation of the use of weapons have entry to
franchisee in homes and are absorbed with the greed of novelty by the mind
Child?

The time we go through the world is truly an hour of great
Density.

It is a time when we hear lucid speeches with beautiful words that hide the
coexistence with the omission and irrationality of those who speak, in what it says
educational arrangements for the little ones.

These children are spirits who come to earth full of trust in their brothers and sisters
that preceded them in the current existence in the earth's orb.

These brothers left in addition promises and projects of care and
guidance to the little ones, precisely to supplant the past of omissions and
despautério already experienced...

These are days of appreciation of appearances.

Moving ideas, very delightable suggestions, official documents with wide
Visibility...

Very well-provided media campaigns, all related to the service of
children, of these little children of God who have just reached the world under the
care of society.

All this is lost in the current of the immediate interest of social projection and
of the unmeasured greed, which divert human and financial resources, valuable and
the route of citizenship and the paths of charity, for
unconfessable.

We join forces, in this way, around childhood and youth,
ardently, because we know that there is still time to reduce the future pains of the
humanity, through the labor we begin now or that we help in their
Maintenance.

We will wax ranks around jesus' teaching, bearing his proposal to
let the little ones find him, until he arrives, without any
impediment on our part, by the earthly paths.

Only when the child is warmed by caring attention, when it is
sidewalk by the well responsible and fed by the love poms
fraternal pater-mater, we can then dream of the world better than so much
Hope.

This message is from someone who observes the events of the physical plane, under the
optics of the "spiritual hemisphere".

It is a spirit interested in building a better world, and that comes in the
bring these serious warnings and at the same time an invitation for us to make the
part that fits us.

It is important to emphasize that our acts are being observed from beyond the tomb.

Even those who do not wish to confess to ourselves.

Now we can understand Jesus' statement, when he said that all that is
hidden will be revealed. Even our most secret thoughts.

A cloud of witnesses follows us in the footsteps and there is no way to escape these beings
Invisible.

Think about it!

And if you're someone who has made any commitment to childhood, you're going to have to
accountability of its administration, sooner or later, to the sovereigns and
inviolable laws of God.

Think about it, but think about it now!
