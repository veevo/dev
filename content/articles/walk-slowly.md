I walk slowly because I've been in a hurry... Hurry to have so many things, to come to
so many places, haste of having, of the opinion.

But today I'm slow, because I already understand that life is a search for you
even, of being: being better, being kind, being friendly, being sensitive, being compassionate,
be charitable...

Today I understand that it takes peace to be able to smile, for the true smile,
authentic happiness, comes from peace of mind, peace of conscience, of whom
follows the path of good at all costs.

I also understand that the rains are welcome, and that without them there are no blooms,
because it takes rain to bloom.

Pain sculpts our souls when well understood, when well absorbed in the footsteps
journals of the read.

I walk slowly because I've been in a hurry... Rush of success at any cost,
rush to be popular, to be the first, to please everyone...

But today I walk peaceful, realizing more the mornings and mornings, the taste of
pasta and apples, absorbing life in its fullness.

Living may be the same, circumstances may remain unchanged, but
my lenses are different. I see everything differently.

And most important of all, I found that to fulfill life, to fulfill my
role, my mission here, I need to understand my own march.

Seneca, ancient sage, stated that no wind is in favor for those who do not know
where to go. So understanding the march is fundamental. We need to know to
where we're going, we need to know what our march is, our lives.

Only then can I go playing forward, with simplicity and devotion, with joy and
Heart.

Because we all have talent, we all carry the gift of being able and being happy.

Happiness is not for the few, no, it is for everyone. And each one finds her
in his time, at his time, in his form.

I walk slowly because I've been in a hurry... Hurry to leave, I've wanted to give up
everything in a few moments, but today I walk like that in slow motion, with the courage
of those who want to stay and see everything to the end.

I carry that smile because I've cried too much, but that doesn't mean i don't
I'll spill some drop of my eyes again. It just means that smiles
will be the rule. The tear, exception.

I walk slowly in my children's short stride, because if it is resolved to ride fast,
I'll leave you behind.

I walk slowly to realize the singing wise, for if I turn my life a
time bomb, step on not realizing the life that passes off my steps, and
thus, the known ones now exist anymore.

I walk slowly to still be able to look where i read, and not crush anything, nor
no one with my inattention or inelegance.

I walk slowly to think a little more before acting, to choose the words
to digest a new idea, to choose a path, to silence the
myself for a few moments.

I walk slowly... because I've had a hurry.

                                   *   *   *

Life is especially rich for you to pass through it, hastily, without paying attention
for the details.

The world is full of beauties so that one will travel to the jumps, without detaining
discovering the beauties of flowers, the secret of the woods, the charm of the fountains.

Let's think about it!
