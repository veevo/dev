Not often, we find kind people in the social tract. They are the ones that
concern about respecting the rights of others, in developing their spirit of
citizenship, in seeking kind words and gestures towards others.

Also, with happiness, we find educated people in our relationships
Social. It is the companions who make themselves attentive, who care about
small gestures, such as greeting the elders, cede the space to the lady
pregnant or just make a phone call to the acquaintance to have news.

But how many people can be generous? If kindness and education
are born of respect for others, develop in the spirit of citizenship and
coexistence, generosity is born in the hearts of those who are ready to love
Fraternally.

Let's find generosity in the friend who can understand our lack
when we forgot his birthday, and, upon finding him later, rather than
charge us for oblivion, simply offers us the open heart and
spontaneous ever.

It will be the fruit of the generosity of the soul when we do not need it, nor do we wait for
a thank you, after having done someone a favor, for the mere fact that
to be able to help those who asked us is enough to fill the heart with
without waiting for any kind of recognition.

And we will be ready for generosity to be our company when, having
reason in the face of a dispute of great importance or a dispute over nodes,
we are able to give up claiming our rights in the name of peace and
of good coexistence.

Jesus advises us to cultivate generosity in our hearts when he says that
someone invite us to take a thousand steps, walk two thousand if necessary. And if
another ask us for the cover, which we also offer the tunic.

We often think that generous is the one capable of opening the safes and
distribute the much you have, when, not infrequently, this much does not even fail will do so.

True generosity is born in the heart that is able to look at the next and
world with complacency and understanding, knowing that we are all subject to
errors, stumbles and deceptions.

We will be generous when we are unconcerned in conjugating the verb to have...
To have something, to be right, to have someone, for our concerns will be those of
Offer... kindness, friendship, companionship, understanding.

Of course we can rehearse the first steps of generosity by touching the
pocket, to offer what we have left to those who have so little.

However, we can always invest more and allow generosity to gain
space in our intimate world, when we are able to forget a little bit of
our wills, our reasons, our longings, to simply sow,
in the ways of others, the flowers scented with the breeze of fraternity.

                                   *   *   *

All who extend invisible hands to sustain lives, institutions
noble, are seeders of new times.

Thanks to them many live, others survive. Some awaken from sadness,
countless imitate them, following in their footsteps.

Generous, anonymous, persevering sowers. Servants of Jesus.

How about we adhere to generosity too?
