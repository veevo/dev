A lot of things talk about Beethoven. The fact that it composed
extraordinary symphonies, even after total deafness, is always remembered.

Precisely because of his deafness, he was unsociable. While you could,
hid the fact that his hearing was compromised.

It avoided people because the conversation had become a difficult practice and
Humiliating. It was the public certificate of his hearing loss.

One day, a friend of yours was surprised by his son's sudden death. So that
i heard, the musician ran to his house, full of suffering.

Beethoven had no words of comfort to offer. I didn't know what to say.
He realized, however, that in a corner of the room there was a piano.

For thirty minutes, he extracted his emotions in the most eloquent way
that could. He played the piano. At the contact of your fingers, the keys triggered issued
laments and melodious harmony of consolation.

As soon as it was over, he left. Later, the friend commented that no
another visit had been as significant as that.

Sometimes, we too, surprised by very sad or shocking news,
we find no words to express comfort or consolation.

We got to the point of not attending a friend's funeral, because he felt he didn't
way to say something to the widow, or to the orphaned children.

We're not going to the hospital, visiting a sick man in our circle of relationships, because
we feel inhibited. How to get there? What to take? What's that supposed to say?

Let us learn from the gesture of the immortal Beethoven. In the absence of words,
let us tell our feelings.

We offer the silent embrace and let the shed of the tears of those who
dress of sadness, drain on our chest.

Let us offer our shoulders to help carry the pain that extracts from the soul,
verspending the body.

We sit next to those who suffer and hold their hands, as to say, with
all the lyrics and no sound: I'm here. Count me in.

We poured a glass of water, a juice to the one who dried the source of tears and
continues with the soul in tatters. This could bring renewed encouragement to the body
exhausted by the seizure of pain.

Let's see if we can't provide a corner for a home, even if
Short.

Let us remain with the friend, even after everyone has withdrawn for their
homes or if addressed to their chores. The hours of loneliness are longer,
when the hands advance the early hours.

                                   *   *   *

Be a convenient friend, knowing how to lead you with discretion and nobility with those
that i elect you friendship.

Discretion is little treasure preserved in the fraternal friendships.

Everyone likes noble and discreet companies that inspire
confidence, favoring tranquility.

Listen, see, accompanies and talks with nobility, being faithful to the trust that in you
