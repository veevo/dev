 Do you consider yourself a selfish person, proud or are you someone who always seeks
practice good?

Maybe the answer to that question isn't that easy, so let's
do an analysis of these three attitudes considering some frameworks and
circumstances of daily life:

In society:

Selfishness does what it wants.

Pride does the way it wants.

Good does what it can, above its own obligations.

At work:

Selfishness explores what you think.

Pride oppresses what you see.

Good produces incessantly.

On the team:

Selfishness attracts to you.

Pride thinks of you.

Good is good for everyone.

In friendship:

Selfishness uses situations.

Pride calls for privileges.

Good relinquishs his own good.

In faith:

Selfishness appears.

Pride complains.

Good listens.

In responsibility:

Selfishness runs away.

Tiranize pride.

Good collaborates.

In other people's pain:

Selfishness forgets.

Pride condemns.

Good back.

In the study:

Selfishness pretends to know.

Pride doesn't seek to know.

Good always learns, to accomplish the best.

Considering these three attitudes, you can assess which one is the one that is the most
highlights in their daily actions.

By doing this analysis you can answer if you are a selfish, proud person
or that acts according to good.

With the evaluation in hand, consider the following:

Selfishness and pride are two dark runners that lead to addiction,
delinquency, to disgrace.

Good is wide and illuminated avenue that leads us to the conquest of virtues
sublime and the supreme happiness we desire so much.

But for that it is not enough just admire good or disclose it. It is necessary, above
all, practice it with all the forces of the soul.

And the decision between one attitude and another rests exclusively with each of us.

                                   *   *   *

Don't forget that the good you do is the only job that does well. And this
service in favor of others is the only charity in favor of ourselves.

Good is the lever capable of freeing man from vices and elevating him to the high
plans of harmony with himself and with the world around him.

Thus, the practice of good is and will always be our best attitude.
