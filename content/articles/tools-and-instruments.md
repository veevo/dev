Since early ages, human beings have learned to develop tools and
instruments to facilitate work and make our existence less arduous.

Of the first stone chips, used to cut, chop and scrape, until
the most modern technological apparatus, which speed up activities and operations,
we have been employing our intelligence in the development and creation of solutions
problems and challenges.

However, just as we create these tools to leverage progress,
a portion of us, driven by greed, pride and selfishness, serve ourselves on them
to impose us on others, to humiliate, destroy, steal.

We created the axe to cut logs and open bites in the forest, enabling
move more resourcefulness.

However, some use it to assault and kill fellow workers, the
in order to steal the fruits of their work and effort.

We created the writing. With it we write laws, songs, books and poems
Wonderful. Others use it to sign death sentences and register
offenses and injuries.

With the plane we've won the air and shortened distances. However, when we
we went back to war, we saw in it the perfect tool to drop bombs
about cities and villages, killing millions of people.

We develop medicines to relieve pain, cure and decrease suffering
Human.

Malicious men use some of these substances to create
mechanisms of escape from reality, producing them on a large scale, helping to
millions of beings who have been lost in indiscriminate drug use.

The invention of the wheel and, later, of the automobile, facilitated our
displacement, also the transport of loads, driving progress.

Some of us, intoxicated by speed, lost our lives in races and cracks
senseless, driven by the illusory pleasure it provides.

The internet was created to safeguard searches and important
possible destruction. Over time, it was open to the public so that it could be
used in the exchange and storage of important data.

Today, several of us have turned it into a repository of uselessness and things without
that occupy millions and millions of virtual pages.

Social networks have made it possible to bring people together who are physically
Distant. But we use them to convey fake news, hatred and aggression,
fruits of intolerance, prejudices and fanaticism of all kinds, distancing
family and friends.

So many other tools and instruments are available to humanity to
foster progress. How we use them depends on the evolutionary level of
that we make use of them.

May we be aware of the way we serve what we have, of the
opportunities we receive to do good and spread examples of love for
Father and next.

Just as we were taught thousands of years ago by Master Jesus.

Let us think in what way we are serving these talents that divinity
allowed us to create, invent, obtain.

And let us seek from them to serve us only for good, for great things,
of those created by a God of love and peace.
