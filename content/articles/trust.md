Trust in one's own forces fills man with courage and willingness to
Fight.

Those who do not believe in themselves assume a defeatist stance.

Before you even try, you admit defeat.

Every enterprise presupposes planning, strategy and work to be
Made.

But the confidence of the possibility of victory is indispensable for it to
Occur.

Some mishaps always arise in the realization of a work of great.

The pessimist sees in them a confirmation of his incompetence.

The optimist seeks to learn from the malogre, makes adjustments on the route, but persists in the
Purpose.

Trust is not necessary only in relation to material aspects of the
human existence.

It is also indispensable in moral and spiritual matters.

Many people are not dedicated to the fraud of their character because they think so
Impossible.

They believe their addictions are genetic inheritance and conform to them.

They assume that gluttony, selfishness, laziness and malevolence are characteristics
Your.

They imagine that moral defects are immutable as eye color and height.

In the meantime, they're wrong.

The body gives no defects and virtues to anyone.

If so, holiness would be just an accident of nature and not
would represent no merit.

Similarly, cruelty and violence would be mere result of the organization
Physical.

Spiritism teaches that all Spirits are potential angels.

They have in germ all virtues, but each must work to develop
talents and abilities.

The transition from ignorance to angelitude is a very long path.

It presupposes countless incarnations to complete itself.

In the evolutionary process, the Spirit sometimes errs and sometimes hits.

Gradually, it gains lucidity and becoming more assertive.

It is always necessary to repair the damage done in unhappy experiences.

However, with each new experience the Spirit accumulates learning and expands the
possibilities to act correctly.

Intellectual and artistic skills, virtues and affinities constitute the
inheritance of what was lived.

But also old misguided habits leave their mark.

Thus, current trends, good or bad, are the result of experiences of the
Past.

If a man is violent, violence is not stems from his physique, but from his
Spirit.

A peaceful and balanced Spirit will not be violent, even if you enliven a body
extremely rude-looking.

Thus, it is important to take full responsibility for what is.

Whatever your characteristics, you've built yourself like this.

But it's entirely in your hands to change.

Your destiny is angelitude.

All the virtues of angels are latent in you.

Get rid of this truth and assume that becoming someone wonderful depends
only of his will, of his effort.

It's certainly not easy to break up with old habits.

Shut up the malevolence, cease the next's frivolous trial, tame the gluttony,
sexuality, all this requires a good deal of effort.

The same is true with the development of compassion, the taste for serious readings
and constructive conversations.

However, it is possible.

You were created to be an angel full of love and wisdom.

Have confidence in your luminous destiny and fight bravely to achieve it.

It's up to you.
