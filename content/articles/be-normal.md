Man is gregarious by nature.

By instinct, he seeks to be close to his fellow men.

Progress is one of the laws of life, the care of which is facilitated by the
exchange of ideas and experiences.

It is natural that men seek to be accepted in their social environment and
familiar.

At all stages of life, the phenomenon of the search for acceptance occurs.

For example, in adolescence, it is remarkable the concern to be part of a group.

Certainly for this, adolescents standardize tastes and behaviors.

They dress, talk and act in a similar way.

It seems different is something scary, as it can lead to pariah status
social.

For life, being normal is comforting.

When a man's conduct and beliefs are shared by others, he
feels safe and comfortable.

Those who assume a differentiated posture tend to be mistreated.

The less, because of your behavior provoke reflections.

What once seemed so settled, maybe it's not.

For most people, it is unpleasant to have to review your posture in the face of the
Life.

When you admit an error, the next step is to engender efforts to
fix it.

As it is easier to remain inert, what leads to reflection is often
Repudiated.

It takes maturity and courage to be different.

Who is unopposed to the standards considered normal, in the environment in which it is inserted,
subject to criticism and rejections.

But being normal isn't always good.

In a world marked by corruption, perhaps dishonest conduct is taken by
normal.

Putting health at risk, due to vices of all order, also does not cause astonishment.

Many like this do so and this behavior does not give up what society tolerates
with tranquility.

Malevolence, sexual unruleracties, the habit of always taking advantage,
none of this seems shocking.

In today's society, nothing is more banal than addiction.

The genuine virtue is rare.

Precisely because of its rarity, it draws so much attention.

In a frivolous environment, the conduct of those who prefer to live honestly and worthily
sounds like a censorship for others.

Think about whether your quest for acceptance isn't making you walk paths
Strangers.

Remember the examples and figure of Christ.

He lived with misguided of every order, but preserved his purity.

He supported the fallen and urged them for good.

His straight conduct and his wise words caused a lot of discomfort.

The important people of the time thought it necessary to kill him, to silence his voice
and to cease its influence.

Ponder it and analyze your life.

See if the concept of normality is not corrupting you.

If you live quietly among corrupt, perhaps corruption has already
Marked.

If your company is greatly appreciated by the frivolous and malevolent, perhaps you
simply be one of them.

If pornography doesn't shock you anymore, you've probably already incorporated it into your
Life.

It certainly doesn't cause you joy to perceive yourself in tune with the wickedness of the world.

So you're sorry to be different.

Be strictly honest, loyal, righteous and kind.

Your presence may be less requested.

But no doubt you will be happier and will have peace in your heart.
