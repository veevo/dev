Everyone talks about the misfortune, everyone has felt it and judges
know him the multiple character.

However, almost all of us are wrong. Real disgrace is not,
absolutely, what we think, that is, what the wretched suppose so.

For us misfortune is in misery, on the stove without fire; in the creditor who
threat, in the cradle from which the smiling angel disappeared; in tears, in the
starch that accompanies itself with a head discovered and with a broken heart; In
anguish of betrayal, in the nakedness of the pride he wished to engage in
purple and evil conceals his nudity under the andrajos of vanity.

To all this and to many things is called doom, in language
Human.

Yes, it's a disgrace to those who only see the present. The real disgrace,
however, it is in the consequence of a fact, more than in the fact itself.

Let us think, if an event, considered said at the time, but that
brings at the falladed consequences, is not really more disgraced than other
which, at first, causes living setbacks and ends up producing good.

Let's see if the storm that rips down the trees, but that sanea the air,
dispelting the unhealthy miasmas that would cause death, is not rather a
happiness than an unhappiness.

To judge anything, we need to see the consequences.
So, to well appreciate what, in reality, is said or untold to the
man, we need to transport ourselves beyond this life, because that's where the
consequences are felt.

Now, everything called unhappiness, according to the shy views
human rights, ceases with body life and finds its compensation in future life.

We can think of unhappiness in a new form, in the beautiful form and
florida that we welcome and desire with our deluded souls.

Unhappiness can be in joy, pleasure, in turmoil, in vain
agitation, in the crazy satisfaction of vanity, which make the conscience silence; That
compress the action of thought; that stun the man in relation to his future.

Unhappiness is the opium of forgetfulness that we ardently seek
Get.

For the child, unhappiness is in respecting the limits and
subjects proposed by parents.

In turn parents, who have a more comprehensive vision of their lives, are
investing in future happiness for their loved ones, teaching them to
living with dignity.

This also happens to us in relation to the established disciplines
by the greatest laws of life. Where we only see the misfortune, is suing the
true happiness.

                           *   *   *

Overcoming the obstacles of the way with courage, we will be acting as
brave soldiers who, far from fleeing danger, prefer the struggles of fighting
peace that cannot give them glory, nor promotion.

What matters to the soldier losing, in the cool, weapons, luggage and uniform,
since you get out of the winner and with glory?

What matters to what has faith in the future leave on the battlefield of life
wealth and the mantle of flesh, as long as his soul among victorious in the Kingdom
Heavenly?

Let's think about it!
