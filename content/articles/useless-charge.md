One day, a teacher, attentive to the behavior of his students, noted that
could help them solve some intimate problems and proposed a
Activity.

He asked everyone to carry a bag and some stones, of various sizes and
forms for the next lesson.

The next day, he advised each one to choose a stone and write in it the
name of every person of whom they felt sorrow, envy, grudge, or jealousy. The stone
should be chosen according to the size of the feeling.

After everyone had finished the task, the teacher asked them to put the
stones in the bag and carried it next to the body to all the places where
were, day and night.

If anyone were to cause them suffering still intensely, they could
replace the stone with a larger one. And if a new person hurt them, they should
Choose a new stone, write her name and put it in the bag.

And whoever solved the problem with some of the people whose names had written
on the stones, they could remove the stone and throw it away.

That's how it was done. Some bags were full and too heavy, but no one
Complained.

Of course, over the days, the contents of the bags increased instead of
Decrease.

The hassle of carrying that weight became increasingly evident.

As the days went by, the students began to show discontent. After all,
accounts, were being deprived of many movements, for the stones weighed and
some injuries have arisen, caused by the protrusions of some stones.

Not to forget the bag anywhere, the students stopped providing
attention on other things that were important to them.

After some time, the students asked for a meeting with the teacher and spoke
that could no longer continue the experience, for they were tired of
carry that dead weight and some injuries bothered.

The teacher, who was waiting for the moment, spoke to them wisely:

This experience was created to show them the size of the spiritual weight that
sorrow, envy, grudge or jealousy cause.

Whoever keeps these feelings in the heart, wastes precious time in life, leaves
to pay attention to important facts, in addition to causing diseases such as
Consequence.

That's the price you pay every day to keep the pain and feelings
negative so we want to keep with us.

Now it's your choice. You have two options: throw away the stones or continue
to keep them daily, wasting forces to carry them.

If you choose intimate peace you will have to get rid of these feelings
Negative.

One by one the students were falling apart from the heavy bags and all were
unanimous in admitting that they were feeling lighter, in every way.

The proposal was to leave with the stones the resentments that each of them
Represented. And that gave each one the feeling of relief.

Finally everyone hugged and confessed that in that simple gesture they discovered
that it's not worth wasting time and health carrying a useless burden and
prejudicial.

                                   *   *   *

Whatever difficulty that drives you to grief, reacts, through the
renewal of purposes, not valuing offenses or considering offenders.
