Narrates the Gospel of Matthew that when Jesus' enemies tried him
involved in a contradiction, whether or not the payment of the
tribute to the Emperor of Rome, the Excelso Master thus concluded teaching: Dai,
for Caesar, what is caesar and God's what is of God.

The answer leads us to deep reflections.

Caesar and God can mean the human and the Divine, the material and the spiritual.

Usually, because we live in the carnal world, we struggle to conquer
material things. That's because this world requires us so much for survival and
enjoy some comfort.

Thus, we apply all hours, or most of them, to the commitments
Materials. Even when we have rest, our goal is to redo
forces for the next day's fight that awaits us, with the same or greater
Intensity.

Involved in everyday life, we program our lives as if it never came to
extinguished by disincarnation.

We elected an exaggerated cult of the body, imagining that he no longer us
we'll break apart. In this fan, we spend countless hours selecting the most
improved diets, appropriate physical exercises, vitamins, herbs, baths
etc.

Of course, when we are surprised by physical death, by the lack of habit
elevation, we can continue in the disturbing and illusory fixation that the
death did not reaperus at the body, remaining by his side.

As men, we live in society and have duties towards it. Need
fulfill our part for the progress of all.

And no one thinks that fleeing the world, under the pretext of serving God, if
Justify. Master Jesus gave us examples of how to live in the world, serving
to men.

He participated in the wedding in Cana, sanctifying them with His presence. He went to the house
of a tax collector, honoring his home.

More than once he stayed in the farm of bethany's brothers. You heard the woman
misguided, teaching him honor. He went to the temple and synagogue, without
prejudice of any kind. Participated in the usual feasts of the people, without
involve in passions.

Everything did with naturalness, discretion and honorability.

                                   *   *   *

Let's learn from Jesus. In our day, we dedicate to God a moment of reflection,
an hour of mercy towards His children.

Let us refer to God our gift, offering ourselves to others.

We live in the world, loving life and serving the world without slavery. And
channel our moral resources to God, working our intimacy
spiritual, imperishable, immortal.


### Did you know?

... that the birth of Jesus was announced by celestial chants and informed
to pastors as a news of great joy?

And he knew that Jesus ended His messianate, among men, in the light of the
day, in glorious encounter in nature, disappearing in the eyes of five hundred
Disciples?

In this way he taught us that life is a poem of joys in the name of love.

Let's think about it.
