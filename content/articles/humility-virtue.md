Can a man be humble without becoming the target of humiliation? Humility leaves
creatures without self-esteem?

Sometimes when we exalt humility, there are people who doubt excellence
of this virtue and believe that being humble is the fastest way to be
trampled by the proud and powerful. It's not exactly like that.

When Jesus taught us about humility, he said that the poor of spirit are
blessed because they would have the Kingdom of Heaven.

But attention: poor spirit does not mean, under any circumstances, being small
ideas or a lower-spirited person.

On the contrary, being poor in spirit simply means being humble,
carry inside the chest a heart capable of not fading easily.

Being poor in spirit represents the conquest of a spiritual state that does not
gives way to manifestations of selfishness.

Being poor in spirit is to seek a spiritual state without pride, without pride,
no vanity.

Have you ever noticed that there are people who think they are superior to others?

They believe that God should grant them privileges and conditions
Special.

Forget that God is the Father of all creatures, which gives rise to the sun on good
and evil, and makes His rain fall upon righteous and unjust.

We are all His dear children and none of us will be lost.

The poor-minded is one who is able to look at all human beings
like his brothers.

He's a good man, beested by the certainty that all people are
deeply interesting and worthy of respect.

The truly humble person does not consider himself superior, nor less than
no one, for he sees in all a universe of intelligence and beauty.

Therefore, the humble does not discriminate, nor mistreat anyone. For him,
rich and poor, intelligent and obtuse, good and evil are, first of all, children
of God.

The differences are only due to his intellectual and moral stage.

A man like this is wise and certainly lives peacefully.

The truly humble man is not proud of his goods, of his wealth, of
intellectual heritage or good looks.

And you act like that because you know everything is a passenger in your inner life.

As we leave this world, all material goods will be left behind, the body
Physical.

Also, long before death, life is already showing us that we are in a
world where things are deeply transitory.

For those who are beautiful and young, it is worth remembering that the body ages.

For those who are healthy, it is wise to remember that diseases can come to any
Moment.

Those who pride themselves on wealth and a good social position should note that
all this can be taken from them at any time.

Those who have work or occupy high roles should also keep in mind that they can
lose such positions at any time.

Therefore, it is worth, in any situation, offer the best of you all,
indiscriminadamente.

The humble man is the same on every occasion. If you are in a situation
unfavorable, remains calm and does not feel inferiorized, because he knows
their potential.

If you live in comfortable conditions, you seek to experience solidarity, joy,
good mood and tolerance.

This is how a future of joy and fulfillment is built.
