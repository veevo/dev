There are people who are confused in the environment where they live to such an extent that they lose their
identity itself. It is to these kind of creatures that Jesus calls a race of vipers.

By mimicry, the ability that certain animals have to take the color and
configuration of the objects in whose environment they inhabit, the viper is confused, so
say, in half, making it difficult to locate you.

Many of us, in adverse situations, prefer to let ourselves be confused with the
kind of being taxed with pious or undesirable moralists.

If we're in the midst of the corrupt, we applaud corruption.

If we meet among addicts, we support addiction.

If we're with the sexolatras, we praise the sexolatria.

If we are surrounded by honest and worthy people, we praise honesty and
dignity.

We lack the moral courage to position ourselves in accordance with our
conscience, regardless of the environment in which we find ourselves.

As Christians, we know what the right stance is, but we prefer to leave ourselves
lead by most thinking of deceiving their own conscience. We forgot the
recommendation of the Man of Nazareth: Be your speak yes, yes, no, no.

Everybody does it! This is the argument with which some of us try to justify
unworthy acts.

At the moment When Jesus refers to pharisees as a race of vipers, he emphasizes
also that all sin or blasphemy will be forgiven to us, except those committed
against the Spirit, against conscience.

What Christ meant is that the misconceptions made out of ignorance, not
will be accounted for by the larger laws as infringement, but as an attempt ill
Successful.

But the offences committed with knowledge of cause, that is, against the
conscience, these will not be forgiven, and the offender will answer for them before
of the laws governing life.

Thus, the excuse that everyone makes will not exempt us from the responsibility
personal staff, for each will be given according to his works, and not according to the works
merit or demerit are individual and non-transferable.

In this way, as much as we try to confuse ourselves with the whole or most,
we will not prevent divine laws from locating us and registering our most
secret intentions.

Let us leave mimicry for animals and take christian posture wherever
let's be, without fear.

Let us be firm in our noble decisions, without worrying about pleasing the
masses, but with the sole concern of pleasing God.

Allan Kardec, by coding the Spiritist Doctrine, had the opportunity to ask
to spirits:

Why, in the world, so often, the influence of the bad guys overcomes that of the good?

The benefactors answered:

For their weakness. The bad are intriguing and audacious, the good ones are shy.
When they want it, they'll preponder.

This and so many other questions are in The Spirits' Book.

Enjoy meeting you this year when you complete one hundred and fifty-six
years of enlightenment and comfort.
