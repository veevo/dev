> "Faith is a powerful remedy."

This is the title of an article published in the March 2000 selections magazine,
written by Phyllis Mcintosh.

The realization that faith is a powerful remedy, arose after several
studies done with people of various age groups and different beliefs
Religious.

Experts have not only studied sick people. They also observed
healthy people and found a possible explanation for the absence of
diseases: faith.

More than 30 studies have detected a link between spiritual commitment or
religious and a longer life, that is, those who dedicate themselves to noble values,
lives more.

A survey of 5,286 California residents found that the rate of
mortality among people attending a religious temple was lower.

Religious people seem to have less tendency to depression, suicide,
alcoholism and other addictions, according to research.

Faith generates hope and a kind of control that fights stress.

For this reason, people who have faith face traumatic diseases better,
suffering and loss.

Studies have also found that prayer influences the growth of bacteria
and wound healing in mice.

In a survey of 269 physicians at the 1996 meeting of the American Academy of
family doctors, 99% said they believe religious faith can contribute
for healing.

When asked about their personal experiences, 63% of physicians said
divine intervention has improved its own health conditions.

Research conducted by Time/CNN magazine and USA-Weekend showed that
about 80% of Americans believe that spiritual faith or prayers
are able to help people recover from illness or injury.

In addition, more than 60% think doctors should talk to patients
about faith and even pray with those who ask.

Perhaps this need to unite religion to medicine is, in part, a
reaction to an increasingly hasty and impersonal health system.

Says Dr. Larry Dossey, author of the book "Praying is a holy remedy": that in
medicine, the pendulum swung so much to the physical side that almost excluded the
spiritual element.

Patients and many doctors do not agree with this and the pendulum begins to
oscillate in the opposite direction.

All these considerations made by physicians and experts from the states
united, come to prove what Jesus had taught for almost two millennia, when
promoted some healing and said, "Your faith healed you."

In general, the human being is unaware of the potential it brings in the
intimacy, in germem.

Jesus said that faith is capable of removing mountains. And figuratively, it was
referring to the difficulties and obstacles that creatures face in their
earthly existence.

Those who have faith can remove the mountains from illnessor bear them with
courage and resignation.

The person who has faith removes the most threatening obstacles, because his
trust in God makes her strong enough to act with courage and the certainty of
that will triumph.

                                      ***

If all men found themselves convinced of the strength they bring in themselves, and if
wanted to put the will at the service of this force, they would be able to accomplish everything
what, to this day, they called wonders and that, however, is nothing more than a
development of human faculties.
