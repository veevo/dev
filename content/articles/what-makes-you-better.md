It is narrated that Leonardo Boff, in an interval of a roundtable conversation about
religion and peace among peoples, asked the Dalai Lama:

Holiness, what is the best religion?

The theologian confesses that he expected him to say: It is Tibetan Buddhism. Or Are
eastern religions, much older than Christianity.

The Dalai Lama paused a short break, smiled, looked his inquirer well
in the eyes, disconcerting him a little, as if he knew of the certain dose of malice
in the question, and stated:

The best religion is the one that brings you closer to God. It's the one that makes you better.

For those who know how to come out of perplexity before such wise response, Boff returned to
ask: What makes me better?

What makes you more compassionate; what makes you more sensitive, more
detached, more loving, more humanitarian, more responsible...

The religion that can do that about you is the best religion...

Boff confesses that he has silenced, amazed, and to this day still rumina to
response received, wise and irrefutable.

The Dalai Lama went to the heart of the question: religion must be useful to us for life,
as a promoter of improvements in our soul.

There will be no more certain religion, more wrong, but the one that is most appropriate
for the needs of this or that people, this or that person.

If it is promoting the Spirit, propelling it to moral evolution and
establishing this fundamental bond of the creature with the Creator –regardless of the
name that this takes it will be a great religion.

On the contrary, if it preaches sectarianism, intolerance and violence, it is obvious
that does not yet adequately fulfill its mission as a religion.

The eminent Spiritism Encoder, Allan Kardec, when he analyzed this
question, received the following response from the Spirits of light:

Every belief is respectable when sincere, and leads to the practice of good. Beliefs
objectionable are those that lead to evil.

Thus, it is clear once again that religion, by seeking to approach us
of God, must likewise bring us closer to good, and of his practice
Daily.

No ritual, sacrifice, no external practice will be fruitful if we do not
do better.

We should make our efforts in life to become better.

Investing in everything that makes us more understanding, more sensitive, more
more responsible.

The best doctrine is the one that best satisfies the heart and reason, and which most
elements have to lead man to good.

                                   *   *   *

Gandhi claimed that a life without religion is like a boat without a rudder.

We certainly all need an instrument that addresses us. So let's look
that religion that speaks to our souls, which consoles us and promotes us as
Immortal spirits we are.

We transmit to our children from an early age this importance of keeping in touch
with the Creator, and to practice good, above all.
