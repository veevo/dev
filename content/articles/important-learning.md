Earth is an immense planet, home to billions of beings who have the
opportunity to live and learn, in a wonderful school.

This planet that houses us is governed by Jesus, to whom nothing goes unnoticed,
in the same way that no sound passes without being noticed by the conductor of a
no matter what number of instruments it composes.

All that occurs to us is the knowledge of our dear Guide and Master, who has already
warned us that soft is His yoke and take His burden, showing that no one will have
a learning load above its possibilities.

However, amid events that cause us concern, not rarely in the
we let us lead by feelings of fear and abandonment.

Being the Earth a school, it is not only a place of folguedos and laughter, but also
tasks and learning. These often do themselves through great
Difficulties.

Epidemics are part of the history of humanity and, in centuries past,
decimated the earth's population.

Medicine, then still in its infancy, had no means of fighting
diseases that sometimes remained for centuries without the hope of
Care.

Hygiene was precarious and favored the spread of microorganisms that
fertile soil in the body of many, associated with poverty and hunger.

But Jesus was attentive and did not fail to send us great researchers as
Louis Pasteur who in the mid-19th century exposes the thesis that microbes
caused the infections.

From this discovery, hygiene habits were slowly incorporated
to everyday life, in a true revolution for the time.

Later, in the midst of the pain and destruction of World War II, the
discovery of penicillin, by Alexander Fleming brings to humanity, finally,
a real possibility of cure for many infectious diseases.

Always attentive to the needs of humanity, our Master has allowed, through
so many differentiated intelligences, the surprising development of science
and, with it, medicine, especially in the twentieth century.

The diseases are not gone, but they can already be cured. Epidemics
continue to emerge, but with the same speed with which they appear, science
unveils a way to control them through vaccines or medicines.

There's no way we're alone in fighting diseases. We always have with us
the high support.

Let us think that such situations do not occur by chance and that bring us many
Teachings.

In these situations science progresses, solidarity between people is greater,
health professionals have the opportunity to relearn to give attention and
welcoming their patients to suffering.

In the face of such dangers we recall basic hygiene care, as well as the
Proper and healthy diet to help our body in your defense. It's a
seek balance in the face of such common exaggerations today.

We value staying in our homes with the family, rather than the
agglomerations in places where addictions easily attract young people, or where the
consumerism debalances financial life.

And we learn to pray, for the prayerful mind strengthens the physical body and the
protects, making it vibrate at a higher frequency.

Let us therefore enjoy these delicate moments for our own learning and,
rather than fear and concern, let's make sure that we're always
Covered.
