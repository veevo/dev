Reverend Martin Luther King Junior, a missionary of good on Earth, right made
Said:

Nothing in the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and stupidity
conscienciosa.

Let us reflect on these strong words.

Accommodation in ignorance itself, or even the option for it, is terrible evil
for the evolving Spirit.

To want to remain in ignorance is to move away from the path of happiness.

Wanting to stay in the cave of shadows, alluding here to allegory
platonic, is to miss the chance to know the sun and all its benfazeja light.

Ignorance cannot be anyone's goal on Earth.

Apparently, this may bring some advantages, as some
unsuspecting, but no, there is no benefit in staying in it.

Similarly, conscientious stupidity is sickening chaga for man and for
woman who wish to grow morally.

Consciously to err is to build your own moral prison of permanent pain.

Opt for the paths of cruelty, selfishness and pride, having the conscience
that they are trails harmful to all, is to condemn themselves to pain voluntarily.

And how many of us, already enlightened by the treasures of a religion, still choose
for evil voluntarily!

Every time we utter coarse words, every time we trample our lives
of others for free, with unfortunate comments, we are acting in evil
Consciously.

How many of us, said Christians, are not able to tolerate or small
Slips?

How many of us, having the ability to do good, choose the path of
accommodation, of indifference, even knowing that times are close, that the
time is now!

Yes, conscientious stupidity is constant danger. Danger of watching life go by
for us, and we lose another chance, after so many that we have already received from the
Divine Mercy.

Many of us who are here, we are repeat offenders in evil, and we receive the blessing
of new opportunity so that, this time, we will take advantage of the incarnation to
grow in love.

In this life, we have the last chance of putting ourselves on the paths of good, of a
time and for all, without further ado, no more waiting, no further reasons for
remain in the warm behavior of cowards.

The signs of the times are there.

Humanity's great transformation is already operational day after day, without ceasing.

Either we will be those of sleeping soul, who we will let such an opportunity pass, or
we will be those engaged in change, in the new era of love and understanding.

Let us be nominated that the greats of the earth have always opted for love, for charity, for the
Forgiveness.

What will be your option?

*   *   *

Humanity has made, to date, undisputed progress.

The men, with their intelligence, came to results that had never
achieved, from the point of view of science, arts and well-being
material.

They are still very much progress to be made: to make that they are
charity, fraternity, solidarity, to ensure that they are
moral well-being.

It is no longer just to develop the intelligence that men need,
but to raise the feeling and, for that, it is necessary to destroy all that
excite in them selfishness and pride.
