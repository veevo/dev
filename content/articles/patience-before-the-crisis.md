Patience before the crisis

Modern man urgently needs to cultivate patience, in the condition of
preventive medicine against numerous evils that lurk.

In a way, victimized by the circumstances of the active life in which it is,
undergoes continuous wear that often leads you to neurotic and aggressive states
or the depressions that annihilate him.

Patience is a reserve of courage to face the most difficult situations
without losing balance.

Patience is a virtue that must be cultivated and whose strength can only be
when submitted to the test that challenges it in the form of a problem.

The traffic hitman; the general agitation; unbridled competition; The
disrespect to individual spaces; the compression of the hours...

In addition, financial limitations; emotional conflicts; the frustrations
and other factors arising from the modern said way of life and the relationship
social, lead man to imbalances that patience can avoid.

Exercising it in small occurrences, without allowing irritation or
will acquire strength and successfully face the most serious situations.

All creatures in transit around the world are victims of intentional traps
or not.

Keeping an eye out and knowing how to face them carefully is the only way to overcome them
successfully.

                                   *   *   *

If you feel provoked by the insults that drive you, act serenely and
move on.

If you missed in a situation that surprised you, return to the threshold and
corrects the misconception.

If you feel wronged, re-examine the motive and dispute the honor of not
Discourage.

If the aggression somehow offends you, keep the calm and you'll see it
fall apart.

Living with creatures is the great challenge of evolution because it results,
on the one hand, their moral situation, and on the other, of their emotional state.

Love for others, however, is only legitimate when it does not wear out or
becomes a cause of censorship or complaint, in relation to the people with whom they are
Lives.

It is easy to love and respect those who live physically distant.

True love is what always relates well to other creatures.

                                   *   *   *

Have you ever set out to be more patient? You've put that as a goal in life,
Ever?

It's important to have clear goals. It is important to say to yourself: I'm more
patient now. I'm not going to let this or that shake me easily.

Thus we begin a process of self-preservation, self-monitoring and, all
once a critical situation presents itself, we can say again: I will not
let this take me seriously.

Each one will be able to develop his method, his way of acting, however, the essence of
this work is on to begin right now, immediately.

Who first starts, first reaping the benefits.
