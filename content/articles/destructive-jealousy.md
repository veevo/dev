Ana's life had become very bad, from the moment she had begun to
suspect that Arthur, her husband, had another wife.

Ana looked at him and felt betrayed. Every time Arthur arrived late from the
even if i said that out the complicated traffic or a meeting of
last minute, she thought, it took me a while because of the other. They must have found themselves
Today. That's why you were late.

The peace of the home was compromised. He came in tired, she was grumpy and
i was looking for all the reasons to complain.

Sometimes she surprised dispersive Arthur. Distant thinking. It was the
enough to think to yourself: Look at how thoughtful you are! I bet
you're thinking about her.

Finally, one day, she decided to follow her husband to surprise him.

He waited for him on his way out of work. He took the car, walked a few blocks and
stopped at the flower shop. She saw when he chose the wonderful flowers and
came out carrying them with affection.

Bad character, she thought. Spending on someone else.

That left her so disconcerted, she started crying. He went home
and threw himself into bed.

He cried a lot.

Shortly after, she heard the door open and her husband arrived. You heard the steps
him on the stairs, climbing up to the couple's room, where she was.

As soon as he saw him enter the room, she sat on the bed, the red eyes of
crying, his hair in disarray and vented:

I've seen it all. You can't deny it. She bought her flowers. Red roses
Wonderful. You betrayed me. You betrayed our love.

Altered, she got up and advanced toward him. To your surprise,
verified that he carried in his hands the beautiful bouquet of red roses.

A little upset, extending the bouquet to her, he said:

Ana, today is our wedding anniversary. Didn't you remember?

Jealousy creates exaggerated cadres, fostering mistrust. Certificate of
insecurity, destroys the relationship by the climate of tension that creates the whole
Moment.

Cultivator of unhappiness, jealousy alters the correct view of the facts,
increasing the importance of small delays, unattended desires,
forgetting of dates and commitments to two.

Creating azedume, poisonthe soul and unassothe thought.

Putting sunglasses in mental vision, everything makes it look bleak, devastating.

A distraction is taken into account of disinterest. The delay for a meeting is
considered disrespectful.

Out of reality always, jealousy provokes disastrous and exhausting scenes, in
situations where a slight inquiry or a conversation to two, with certainty,
Solve.

                                   *   *   *

Let's never let jealousy stun us. He's responsible for the devastation
of hearts and homes.

If we feel insecure, we will fortise the relationship to two with more
deep, with exits for a moonlight ride or a lonely weekend.

If the other is truly allowing the relationship to cool down, that the
love, we provide the best for the narrowing of affective bonds,
keeping sure it is in the small gestures that the relationship strengthens itself.
