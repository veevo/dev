Have you ever heard of intimate reform? Almost always, the term awakens in the
people the idea that everything in itself is wrong and needs to be reworked.

Or, otherwise, that it carries only negative, bad things, that
should be modified.

The term reform means rectification, change. But also, improvement,
improvement, give better shape to something.

Let's see, when we say we're going to do a makeover in our house, not this
means she's bad. You might simply want to say that we want
improve it, enlarge it, make it more comfortable.

Thus, the reform can understand an external repainting, because the current one is
starting to peel or is faded, for the long exposure time
to the weather.

During a reform inspection, we can find that we need to
replace the floor of a room, a wall, a piece of the ceiling.

Who knows, replace some broken tiles, gutters.

Of course, we will find in the house that we have to retire, a
almost ideal room, which, at least for now, requires no retouching.

It is a cozy place, with good lighting, well-arranged furniture, painting
Excellent. Anyway, everything's fine there and it won't need to be touched, as
we said, not now.

Because that's also when you talk about intimate reform. Analyzing our
individual provisions, our way of being, of thinking and acting, we will
find out we have flaws, yes. However, also virtues.

The defects are those we must strive to free ourselves.
Naturally, little by little.

Just like the renovation of any house, whether by conditions
financial conditions, whether by technical conditions, is not a day before the
Other.

Time, effort, attention is what is required to free ourselves from defects
small and large.

It is jealousy that fears appearing, the impatience that makes us explode by almost
nothing, the speaking selfishness louder.

As every makeover has to do with a certain mess, bald dirt,
wood and dust, when we start intimate reform, sometimes we will feel
as if everything was very bad.

It will seem to us that we only have flaws and we will never overcome them.

Patience with us! Nature does not give leaps and vices of many years
will need time to be debrated.

One day, with the reform completed, everything will be tidy, well disposed, in place
Correct.

And, of course, our soul adorned with the lush flowers, the delicate vases of the
virtues conquered.

                                   *   *   *

Jesus the Master, in order to encourage creatures to their own improvement
taught that whoever was on the roof did not descend into the interior of the house;
that whoever was in the country did not return to the city.

The invitation is for, after the stages, the small shortcomings, abolished
some mistakes, let us not be allowed to commit them again.

Let us never allow ourselves to be alone today, because this will take long,
much more.
