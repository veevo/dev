Certain words and expressions sometimes have their sense misrepresented or reduced.

Thus, it occurs with discipline, often understood as submission to a
external agent.

The term would refer to the action subject to the will of others.

For example, the father who disciplines his son or commander who conducts his
troops under a severe disciplinary regime.

Although discipline in the outside aspect is necessary, it is not necessary to
Limited.

In reality, it is from the inner prism that discipline reveals its richest
Potential.

It is a virtue that enables the acquisition of all others.

Without discipline, there is no advancement and moral and intellectual transformation.

The undisciplined creature remains as it always has been.

Their addictions and weaknesses do not find firm opposition and the same errors are
incessantly repeated.

Discipline acts on the will plan.

It lays down rules and defines what future behavior should look like.

The disciplined man tells himself he must do and holds firm in the
Purpose.

Even against its natural interests and trends, follows the
improvement that has been set as a target.

Discipline consists of an inner force that allows the alteration of old
Habits.

It is not just about deciding to be better, but to put into practice what is
Decided.

Certainly there are falters, but soon the disciplined man resumes his project
Initial.

He does not allow himself to give up, when he realizes the viability of the goal he elected
for yes.

All spirits, currently bound to the earth, have gone through countless
Incarnations.

In the long learning process, they have made many misconceptions and developed
bad habits.

Certain trends of the remote past are still present in men today.

In the early days of evolution, the Spirit was stripped of intellectual and
more complex morals.

The concerns of being boiled down to the preservation of life and the perpetuation of
Species.

The time not spent with the satisfaction of these needs was dedicated to idleness.

Thus, the excessive taste for rest resembles the primitive phases of existence
Immortal.

The same is true with the unmeasured concern with food and sex.

Nothing is wrong with the satisfaction of the elementary needs of life, in a
context of dignity.

Addiction lies in excess and fixation of thought in activities that are
merely instrumental.

The destination of the human spirit is excellent.

It is up to him to beat himself, free himself from primary habits and prepare
for transcendental experiences of intellect and feeling.

It turns out that this is only possible with a lot of discipline.

Without a firm will applied in the correction of one's own behavior, no one
Advances.

Bad habits, such as malevolence, gluttony, laziness and sexual levity, do not disappear
by themselves.

They must be courageously faced and subdued.

Abandonment of addictions is slow and painful.

In the beginning, the necessary effort is herculean.

But you gradually realize the weight that the bad trends represent.

There is a sense of freedom and lightness, with the adoption of a pattern worthy of
Behavior.

So what was difficult becomes easy and pleasurable, for discipline generates
Spontaneity.

Think about it.
