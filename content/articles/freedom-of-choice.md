Every day we are led to make the most varied choices.

From banal options such as the clothes we will wear to what we will do to
our future.

Some of these choices are extremely simple and others, of great
Relevance.

On many occasions, of course, our option power is limited to the conditions
financial, social and even physical ones available.

However, in general terms, we have the power to print in our existence the
standard of happiness or affliction with which we wish to live.

Freedom is the Law of Life, which is part of the concert of universal harmony.

We are what we do ourselves, moving in the direction we choose.

The pursuit of happiness is a common goal among all human beings.

We all aim, somehow, to achieve it.

Each being idealizes it differently from the others.

For some happiness is to have a family.

For others it is to be healthy and feel good.

Or, it is confused by some with material comfort.

In reality, we know that true happiness is not of this world, as in
taught Jesus.

We are aware that we will only achieve the state of full happiness when
achieve perfection for which we are destined, but that still this is
something far from our current condition.

However, to aim for happiness, even if relative, is something natural and that we
impels growth.

We can and should be happy, though we are still interning on a planet
evidence and atonement.

We have freedom of choice for that.

If we find ourselves attached to the car of afflictions, it is up to us to persist in the
way of good, without fading.

The difficulty of now is the effect of the folly of the past.

Unfortunate situations change for the better, such as landscapes covered by the
shadows are quickly taken by the sun.

We are lords of our destiny.

It is not appropriate to give ourselves to sadness, idleness, to the Complainants.

He who prefers to suffer has freedom for this experience so far in
that you decide to choose true well-being.

In this way, we should not transform small-scale incidents, things and
common occurrences in tragedies.

No one has the fate of suffering.

Pain is the result of the negative action of the past, close to or not, never a
Cause.

Let us make an honest assessment of our existence, without a conscience of guilt,
without excist pieguism.

Let us assess whether our actions, our choices now, will be reasons for suffering
or perhaps later.

Let us see how we are behaving before the world and before ourselves, under
the pretext of achieving happiness.

Being happy or not is also an option given to us daily.

We can only analyze objectively and sincerely whether our choices are
legitimate and fair.

After all, there is no way to be happy at the expense of other people's pains and anguish.

For, for certainly, more day, less day, this kind of situation will be,
inevitably, our own suffering.

We are free to sow what we do well, aware, however, of
that we will be compulsory and inwardly linked to the harvesting of their
Fruits.
