Raul was an ophthalmologist. His years of clinical and surgery had earned him
fame and money. Though the applause of the world, the award-winning works, was a
kind heart.

I never asked the patient whether or not he had a currency resource to
pay it. I just answered him.

Scholar and researcher, the years have allowed him to improve the surgical technique
and, with joy, he was seen returning sight to the blind.

His world was science, the family, and his innumerable sick.

One of her daughters married and became the mother of a beautiful girl. Your eyes
were very beautiful and Raul fell in love with his granddaughter. Whenever possible, I took it
in their arms, they went out walking.

The girl, in turn, loved her grandfather.

One day, the girl got seriously ill. The disease affected his eyes. Raul
I didn't eat or sleep. It stood next to the sick, while devouring the
books, seeking a way to return the light to the eyes that were their own
Life.

Her ability was able to get her to see again with one of the
Eyes. But the other moved from its orbit and was hopelessly lost.

Raul seemed to go crazy.

Soon he, who had returned sight to so many, was impotent in the face of the tragedy of
Net.

What was science for? " He wondered, for nothing.

Acabrunhado, he began by denying to feed. A few days still served
water. Then he started refusing her, too.

I muttered between teeth: I'm no good for anything anymore. And when it's not good for
nothing, it's better to leave the place to another.

He starved to death. Pride and rebellion lost him. A life so full of blessings
thrown away.

Pride blinded him. By being powerless to solve the granddaughter's problem, his
despair reached a superlative degree.

Unable to serve those he loved so much, preferred to die. Could not
bear the idea of his smallness, of his limited power.

                                   *   *   *

The fact may well serve as a warning. Those who believe in the above-humanity of
wisdom and we do not realize that even if we embrace the whole science of the
Earth, very limited will still be our knowledge.

Because in the face of so many worlds, so much light and greatness of the Universe, we can
simply consider us students of the great university of infinity.

The true sage is what recognizes his achievements, but herelata,
equally, how unknown it is to him. That is why it is committed every day to
another step in knowledge.

For man, pride has been somethingic. How many minds are advanced,
illustrious personalities have been lost by pride.

Pride that makes the creature crebelieve itself infallible, unsurpassed. And yet,
only God the Father is infallible, omnipotent, because it is absolute perfection.

                                   *   *   *

All the great heroes of thought, the martyrs of faith and the saints of the
waiver to achieve the success of the objectives to which they linked the existence, if
established in humility, because they knew of the little value they represented in the face of
guidelines of life.
