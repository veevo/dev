The prison was built in bare stone on the outskirts of Jerusalem. In it, the
soldiers imprisoned Him.

She had spent the night nearby, awaiting the unfolding of the tragic
Events.

In the endless dawn, he remembered the words heard, at Simon's house, after
bathe the Master's feet with his tears: Woman, for much loved, all
your sins have been forgiven.

Dawn has resolved his memories, with the unusual movement of
Legionnaires.

Then she saw Him be taken to the palace of the Roman prosecutor, Pontius
Pilate, where the trial was consumed, arbitrary and without any connection. For the
Rabbi, he was destined for death on the cross.

When the heavy logger sat on Jesus' lacerated back, a pain
the heart of Mary, magdala's repentant.

She, near Mary of Nazareth, accompanied Him along the distance separating the
city of Jerusalem of Golgotha, the hill of crucifixion.

They followed him yet, John, the youngest disciple, some women and passers-by
Curious.

But in His slow agony, He marched alone. And Mary Magdalene began to reflect:

Less than a week ago, greeted with joy by countless people who launched
flowers and palms on His way, the Master had entered through the main door of
Jerusalem.

The men removed their robes and stretched them on the floor, in the guise of carpets to
jesus to pass. The mothers showed their children so that He would bless them.

Voices rose by singing hostess to the Son of David.

Where were these people now? Where were Pedro, Thiago, André, Filipe?
Where were the friends?

Where were the blind to whom He had restored his vision? The deaf for whom
Did he return the hearing of the sounds of nature? The monies He had unleashed
of madness?

Following Jesus' painful steps, Mary had a sudden understanding:

As he entered Jerusalem, he had not been the one who had set foot on flowers, in the palms, in the
extended mantles. Apart from the animal on which He was riding at that time.

She understood that, at that moment, Jesus proved to be a true bridge between
the human creature, still imperfect, and the Creator, Father of all of us.

With tears dampening his eyes, he remembered his words, which never
before they had sounded so significant and revealing: I am the Way, the
Truth and Life. No one goes to Dad but for me.

                                   *   *  *

For a moment, we silence our emotions and thoughts. Let us turn our eyes back to
Jesus.

Let us feel His hands involving ours. As a Good Shepherd, He calls us for the
Name.

Guided by the footprints he recorded in our ways, let us make sure the
our steps. Let us make an effort to initiate the abandonment of selfishness,
pride, vanity, arrogance, avarice.

Enveloped by the light of the Master, that our journey leads us to love, forgiveness,
to charity, kindness, fraternity, faith.

Jesus is the bridge, the way and the guide. Let's have the guts! Let us cross the
our poor human condition for angelitude!
