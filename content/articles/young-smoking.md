"Young smoker has five times more risk of heart attack, study says.

People under 40 are five times more likely to 
heart attack if they smoke, according to a new study.

The international team of researchers said their findings refute the 
idea that only older smokers run the risk of heart disease.

The study, based on data from the World Health Organization (WHO), determined with 
people between 22 and 64 years of 21 countries, was published in the journal tobacco
control.

The British Heart Foundation has stated that work works as a
deep alert for young smokers.

Researchers from centres in Europe, China, Australia, New Zealand and
North America, analyzed problems linked to the heart, which did not lead to the 
death, which occurred between 1985 and 1994.

Almost 23,000 cases were reviewed and it was found that four out of five cases were 
victims between 35 and 39 years were smokers.

Men aged 35 to 39 who smoked had a five probability
times greater than having a heart attack than nonsmokers.

The impact was even greater among smoking women of the same age group. To 
they, the probability of heart disease is even greater than five times.

Smoking accounts for almost 65% of non-fatal heart attacks between 
men, and by about 55% among women aged 35 to 39 years.

Risks for smokers in the range of 60 to 64 years are lower because there are other 
factors that contribute to possible heart problems.

But the researchers found that smoking still poses a high risk 
for older women compared to men.

They believe that women are more sensitive to the effects of smoking."

This information was published by BBC-Brazil on 24 August 2004.

It is regrettable that all this information, well founded by experts, 
the effects they should have on youth do not arise.

Our young people continue to adhere to this free poison and destroy their lives.

At other times, when there was no means of proving the damage caused by 
by cigarette, there was a mitigating of ignorance, but in the middle of the 21st century there was no
has excuses.

When Hollywood aired on movie screens the "good guys" always with a cigarette
between our fingers, we could understand that many young people would be carried away by this
destructive wave.

But nowadays, when many of the good guys in the cinema have already been defeated by the 
cigarettes and other vices, it is not appropriate for young people to continue to
slowly poisoning.

Nowadays it is already known that the scenes of heroism displayed by the seventh art do not 
are recorded by the good guys, but rather by professionals who replace them, the
called stuntmen.

Even in fiction these actors, regarded as heroes, are indeed.

For all this it is worth reflecting on what reasons young people are 
deliver to this cruel and devastating addiction of lives.

Is it in the name of freedom? Or it will be to prove that they are more men or more 
Women?

It is important to remember that truly free man is what is imposed on 
vices and not what they submit to them.

Surrendering to vices to prove independence is at least childish.

And in this case, a childishness that can cause great suffering for you and
for his loves, in addition to abbreviation of life.

It is worth considering that youth and addictions do not match. After all, young man is 
the one who faces the life of "clean guy".

You're still young and have physical and mental health, think about it!
