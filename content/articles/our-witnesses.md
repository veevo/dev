The Apostle Paul, in one of his epistles, wrote that we are surrounded by
a cloud of witnesses.

He was referring to the Spirits who observe us and who reach us, where
we are, because for them there are no physical barriers.

We are constantly seen and influenced, wherever we are.

Some witnesses are in the physical body, as ourselves and opine about
of what we do, how we act, of the thoughts we externally externalise.

They are our family members, our neighbors, our co-workers, friends,
both the social and all sectors of our relationship life.

That is why it is important that our conduct is worthy -- so that those who
observe have a positive example in us.

So by doing we will be a good influence for those around us.

If, during the vigil, we can steal ourselves from the incarnate witnesses, in the
collecting certain places or not talking about what we're thinking, the
even if it does not occur with spiritual witnesses.

Without the physical body, the souls of the men who have died and what we call
Spirits, they observe us steadily.

As they can read our mind, it is important to know that the quality of our
thoughts and our actions is decisive in attracting one or the other kind
of spiritual witness.

If we think of evil, if we send thoughts of revenge, of rematch; If
we live to complain about life, in constant dissatisfaction; if we only have
words of criticism of what happens around us; if ours is always the
manifestation of ill will, of not collaborating, of course, we will attract, to
near us, creatures that vibrate in the same way.

That's why some people say they feel like a shadow accompanied them,
as if they were being watched.

Otherwise, if we are people willing to get it right, to help, of
collaborate; if we always have a word of encouragement to those who find themselves in
difficulties; if we cultivate good and wholesome thoughts; if ours is the
interest in learning, illustrating the mind, dulcifying the heart; if we get so sorry
in modifying habits that are not very happy; the companies we will attract
will be those of the Spirits who wish us to assist, to fortify the spirit.

Our guardian angel, too, will be ready to encourage us to
produce good.

The friendly Spirits, those who are interested in which we enjoy very much
the present incarnation will vibrate with us, encouraging us.

That way, we will have many creatures cheering for us, inspiring us and
hoping that we will take the step, that we will make the most broad progress.

This all tells us that there is no doubt that we are solely responsible
by the spiritual companies we have.

And if, on Earth, we usually tell me who you're seeing, i'll tell you who you are.
, in terms of spiritual companies, we can say: Tell me what you think and
I'll tell you who you're seeing.

Let's think about it and select our companies on Earth and those of the world
Spiritual.
