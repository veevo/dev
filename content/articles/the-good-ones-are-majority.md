A national marketing campaign has brought a beautiful and hopeful truth.

Scattered throughout the cities, several billboards revealed some statistical data
very interesting. Here are some of them:

For every person saying that everything will get worse, there are a hundred couples planning to have
Children.

For every corrupt there are 8,000 blood donors.

While some destroy the environment, 98% of aluminum cans are already
recycled in Brazil.

For each tank manufactured in the world, one hundred and thirty-one thousand animals are made
plush.

On the Internet, the word love has more results than the word fear.

For every wall that exists in the world, two hundred thousand rugs are placed written
"welcome."

While a scientist draws a new weapon, there are a million mothers doing
chocolate crayons.

There are reasons to believe. The good ones are majority.

                                   *   *   *

We are in need of optimistic and positive vision like this in our world.

Those who wish to see the world panic and feed on bad news -
because they say they are the ones who sell -- they can no longer control our
Feelings.

We, as consumers of news, information, should show that
we also wish to see the good side of the world, of life, of people.

If we look at any news, whether local or national, we will still
realize the great domination of bad news, as if the world were
living the absolute chaos.

It's not like that. Very good is being done at the same time they occur
murders, accidents, political crises, etc.

Good is being built in the world, yes, even pessimists and terrorists
on duty saying no or even refusing to see.

What happens is that often the good ones are still shy and afraid. Right
prevents them from overlapping the evil bulhentos and dashing.

Allan Kardec, in The Book of Spirits, questions, in item 932:

Why, in the world, bad people generally have greater influence on the good?

Here's the answer you got from the Spirits:

It's for the weakness of the good. The bad are intriguing and audacious, the good are
Shy. When the latter wants it, they will dominate.

Let us continue to reflect on this latest statement: When the good ones want,
will dominate.

Let us reflect our role in this change. What can I do to get part
in this peaceful and definitive domination of good on the face of the earth.

Let us allow our gestures of love to win the world and show in the shadow that their
domination days are numbered.

Streak the sun of a New Age. The time of love has finally arrived.

Let us be part of this transformation of joy that will take care of the orb. Love
More. Let's take a closer look. We smiled more.
