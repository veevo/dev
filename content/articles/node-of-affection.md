At a parent meeting in a suburban school, the principal encouraged the
support that parents should give their children. I also asked them to make
present as long as possible.

She understood that although most of the fathers and mothers of that community
worked outside, they should find a little time to devote themselves and understand the
Children.

But the director was very surprised when a father stood up and explained, with
his humble manner, that he had no time to talk to his son, nor to see him,
for a week.

When he went out to work, it was too early and his son was still asleep.
When he was returning from work it was too late and the boy was no longer awake.

He also explained that he had to work like this to provide for the support of the
Family.

But he also said that it made him distressed that he didn't have time for the
son and who tried to redeem himself by going to kiss him every night when he arrived in
Home.

And for the son to know of his presence, he tied a knot at the tip of the sheet
that covered him.

This happened, religiously, every night when I was going to kiss him. When the
son woke up and saw the knot, knew, through him, that the father had been there and the
had kissed.

The knot was the means of communication between them.

The director was thrilled with that simple and exciting story.

And she was surprised when he found that this father's son was one of the best
school students.

                                   *   *   *

The fact makes us reflect on the many ways a parent is made
present, to communicate with the child. That father found his, simple but
Efficient.

And the most important thing is that the son perceived, through the affective knot, what the father
I was telling you.

Sometimes we care so much about how to say things and forget about the
that is communication through feeling.

Simple gestures like a kiss and a knot at the tip of the sheet, were worth, for that
son, much more than empty gifts or excuses.

It is valid that we care about our children, but it is important that they
know, let them feel it.

In order for communication, it is necessary that children hear the language of our
heart, for in matters of affection feelings always speak louder than
words.

It is for this reason that a kiss, coated with the purest affection, cures the pain of
head, scratch on the knee, jealousy of the baby who stole his lap, fear of the
Dark.

The child may not understand the meaning of many words, but knows
register a gesture of love.

Even if this gesture is just a node. A knot full of affection and affection.

What about you? Have you ever given any affective knot so on your son's sheet today?

                                   *   *   *

If you are one of those fathers or those mothers who really need to get away from the
home to provide for the family's livelihood, remember that you can find your
own way of guaranteeing your child their presence.

You can find a way to tell him how important he is in his
life and how much you love him.

But remember the language of the heart. Of this language that can be felt,
despite the physical distance.

And try to tighten the bonds of affection, for these are the true links that
unite with the beings we love.

Think about it, but think about it now!
