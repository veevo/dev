Certainly, in almost all disorders in the area of sexuality, the
presence of spirituality refractory to light is actively present,
participating as a cause or even adjunct to the process. The Book of
Spirits, in question 567, of course, teaching us that spirits
vulgar son of our pleasures because they are incessantly
our surroundings, actively taking part in what we do, according to the
vibratory in which we find ourselves.

Indeed, in sexual compulsion or nymphomania, the deleterious performance of beings
unenlightened spiritual spiritual is active, presenting itself as true
vampires, sucking the vital energies of patients. The excelsive systematizer
Spiritist Doctrine, Allan Kardec, in Genesis, chapter 14, defines the
obsession as "(...) the persistent action that a bad spirit exerts on a
individual." It also says that "it has very
different, ranging from simple moral influence, with no outside signs
perceptible, until the complete disturbance of the body and the faculties
mental."

Based on spiritist teaching, we can affirm that, in order for the process to be
obsessive, it is an essential condition that there is an essential condition on the part of the victim.
moral imperfection, which provides ascendancy to the lower entity.
Therefore, in order for sexual obsession, for example, to establish itself, is
necessary, then, that the obsidiado allow the entry of the obsessive,
checking marked affinity, linking the two creatures, even
sharing both of the same purposes and desires.

In sexual obsession, therefore, both the incarnated and the
entities are together vibratorly, intertwined in tenacious webs, in
sinister spiritual symbiosis, acting spirits as true
parasites, sucking the vital substance taken from the force fields,
especially splenic, as well as the externalized energy of ecstasy
sexual.

In fact, the leeches spirits were already dragging themselves through the
demeaning sex currents, while still incarnated. Freed from
cellular prison, by disincarnation, still attuned to the
delusions of rampant sexuality, although, in this situation, to
continue in addiction, depend on the action of the incarnates who are
associated in the same sick range of behavior.

Very well known, especially in the Middle Ages, the myth of the "incubes" and
"succubi", consisting of the presence of malefic entities, seeking the
people, while sleeping, to seduce them, with the phyto of stealing their
vital energy. The word "cube" derives from the Latin "incubare" (pour in
above) and designates male inferior beings, and "succubus", comes from
"succumbere" (lie down), marking the clover entities of
female presentation.

In relation to the subject, in Brazil, specifically in the North region, there is a
a legend in which there is the description of an incube, presenting itself as a mouth
pink, who would turn into a seductive man, to the search for girls
on the riverbank.

During sleep, according to spiritist teaching, there is the complete emancipation of
soul, in a natural animic process called unfolding or
spiritual projection, facilitating the action of vicious entities, drawing the
vital essence of the incarnate. The more exhausted the victim is, the greater the
ease will have to detach and suffer the lower harassment (Q. 407 of O
Book of Spirits).

It is important to consider that the individual who practices with excessive
regularity the sexual act, with responsibility, cannot be framed
compulsive in any way, since the disease is characterized by the
impetuosity for the practice of sex, without any scruple, not
respecting the place and the people. Addicted individual can't resist
to the impulses that dominate his senses entirely.

The sexolatra spirits are strongly satisfied by participating in the
sexual encounters sponsored by their faithful incarnate victims,
, getting around with the energy released before and
after orgasmic sexual complementation, using patients addicted to
linked to them, completely dominated, through their fields of forces
perispirit, especially the genoesico.

As a result of the obsessive process, incarnated individuals are
intensely obsessed with sex, due to the pernicious and very strong
influence of spiritual vampires, which make their subordinates
always feel sexually dissatisfied, so that they are always
conducive to rampant sex and can care for their pressing
Needs.

One of the most serious forms of sexual obsession is extreme dependence that
people experience sex, completely addicted and subdued,
having sex, in large numbers, several times a day, with
prostitutes and, in their absence, even practicing sex with beggars,
on public roads.

Like any dependent, the patient does not bother and does not consider being
with a serious obsessive disorder. The "plug only falls" when the patient
lies at the bottom of the well, with its health shaken, family and social life
conflict and living with problems at work. Usually, it is the
family and friends who perceive the disorder, since the addict exhibits
strange behavior, not only at home, but at work, with prejudice in the
performance, professional or in studies, often going to the
bathroom for self-eroticism, the handling of erotic magazines, observation
constant videos of pornographic content, internet use for sex
the appearance and recurrence of sexually transmitted diseases and the
constant harassment of people for sexual purposes, with a marked exchange of
sexual partnerships.

The disease predominantly affects the male sex more, and in the
femalegender has a lower incidence and higher rejection of society. The
story tells that there was an empress called Messalina, third
wife of the Roman emperor Claudius and bearer of obsessive disorder
sexual intersupulated with dozens of men in a 24-hour period.
Due to addiction, she became a lascivious, libertine and dissolute woman in
excess, getting to the point of having sex even with slaves,
characterizing a high intensity sexual compulsive involvement, with
undisputed inferior spiritual commitment.

Messalina, in disembodiment, certainly presented her garment
spiritual spiritual ly compromised and demanded considerable help from the
doctors of the extraphysical dimension. Since there is no eternal suffering, he received,
sure, the merciful opportunity to pay off their debts in
innumerable dips in the meat.

The sharply feminine spirit, trapped in the webs of sex
destonating, causes entirely desarmic sexual vibrations,
linked to the male sex, due to his thinking being directed at
pathological form for male, completely different from the field
sexual sex in the psyche of depth, essentially feminine.
By reincarnating, during the conception phase, of the union of gametes, forming
the egg or zygote, vibrating intensely in a desarmical way to sex
male, exerts attraction to a sperm containing the chromosome
Male Y. Although it has predominantly female psyche, will be born
in male body, essentially atoning.

On the contrary, the extraphysical being, with his psyche sharply
male, also in the same karmic involvement, reembodies in body
Female. The explanation appears in an enlightening way by the instructor
silas, through the transcription performed by André Luiz, in the book
Action and Reaction, chapter 15: "(...) On many occasions, when man
tyranny the woman, stealing her rights and committing abuses in the name of
his alleged superiority, disorganises himself to such an extent that,
unconscious and unbalanced, is led by the agents of divine law to
painful rebirth, in female body, so that, in extreme discomfort
intimate, learn to venerate in the woman his sister and companion, daughter and mother,
before God ...".

Spirit, experiencing intense suffering, externalizes vibrations
sickening and, at the time of blessed reincarnation, by divine mercy,
exactly during the fertilization process, it exerts attraction on a
sperm containing the X chromosome, since its mental field is
directed pathologically to the opposite sex, although it is situated in
a predominantly male sexual band.

The law of cause and effect follows its natural course, with man taking the
free will to go the path you wish to draw, but its
consciousness will always echo at the right time (sowing is free, the harvest
will always be mandatory). In past experience, having been selfish, subdued
the woman, disrespecting her nature, using sex in a way that
Outrageous. Now, reincarnated in a female body, you will learn to respect
people who are situated in this polarity.

During childhood, you will notice in advance that you have a problem of order
atoning, reincarnated in a body endowed with sex of periphery (female)
totally contrary to predominant (male) deep-depth sex.
You'll think and you can act differently from the sex you're a carrier of. Bodies
women housing an essentially male psyche.

Important antidepressant medication, especially when using
medicines known as selective serotonin recapture inhibitors,
because serotonin, when too much inhibits sexual desire,
causing decreased libido.

Sexual compulsion is obsessive-compulsive disease, and spiritual treatment is
very important, requiring addicts of great consideration and attention,
as the Gospel of Christ exhorts, and must receive, duly in the
Spiritists, like any obsidiados, the resources of prayer, pass,
fluidized water and important work of the desobsession.

All those who find themselves tormented and disoriented in the waves
disturbing of dearmtonic sex, know that their dysfunctions have treatment
and that the kind God cares for all his children and provides them with the
opportunity to be victorious in the inner world of struggles,
tribulations, re-education and improvement.
