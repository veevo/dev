The chores on Saturday mornings, in that family, were routine, almost
Traditional. It was cleaning day.

It was up to the mother to coordinate the activities, distributing to her daughters the duties
while the children fit the duties of the world.

Unfair or not, this was the current family structure.

One morning, after great physical effort and dedicated time, Cecilia finished
wax and make the living room floor shine.

Without the resources of technology, make the wooden planks, spent on the
time, gleaming just as the mother wanted, it was no easy task.

Almost completing the service, his twin brother Jeremiah came at the door.

Upon seeing him enter the room, Cecilia immediately forbade him to take a step to
More. He stated that he should go around, through the back of the house and enter through the
Kitchen. No way of crossing the room, perfectly bright, as
desired the mother.

He insisted and took a few steps inside. She, tired, was very angry
and cried out, If I step into this room, which I'm just waxing, I never speak again
with you!!

Brother thought the challenge was fun. He laughed and walked, in firm footsteps, room inside.

Furious at the dusty footprints of her brother, who stood on the other side, the
to confront her, taking everything as a great joke, Cecilia fulfilled her
Promise.

In the early days, all family members believed that it was a
Beer.

However, the weeks were swift, and the silence between the two did not
Modified.

She did not give in, for she had made a promise clearly. He wasn't getting close,
because I saw in all a childishness of the sister.

The years have been added. Silence became a habit between the two.

They were in love, each of whom married and left their parents' house, constituting
their own families.

The years have not changed the disposition of any of them. No one gave in, tried
rapprochement, dilute something that had happened, on a day that was already distant.

Twenty-five years have passed since that nonsense on a Saturday morning.

The phone rang and the news struck Jeremiah's heart like a frosty
Dagger.

She quickly went to meet her sister in the hospital, victimized by an accident
vascular cerebral.

When he saw her immovable in bed, he realized the years after, of the great nonsense that
both allowed themselves.

Out of pride, they kept quiet for so many years, moved away from each other,
no longer live together, to further strengthen the bonds of affection.

All for not wanting to give in, not take the first step, make the first gesture, in the
sense of reconciliation, a simple apology.

Why is that? - He wondered, stunned, before his still sister, on the bed of the
hospital.

What is the price of such absurd pride? Give up coexistence, sharing
life with her, out of pride.

After all, he had always hoped that she, who had made the promise, to take the
initiative of reconciliation and to speak again, to live together.

Now, in the face of the hard lesson, he was able to aquilatar the price he had paid for his
Pride.

Soon i'd find out that her sister wouldn't return to consciousness.

                                   *   *   *

Foolish pride what we carry in our hearts. Let us rethink our attitudes and, if
we find out that someone awaits our apologies, we walk towards you, of
without waiting for tomorrow.

Let us take the first step, reach out, smile, live well.
