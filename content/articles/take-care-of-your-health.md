In daily activities, you find a lot of inattention to health, lived
by gigantic number of people.

Watching well, sincerely, maybe you're in on this number yourself
individuals who disrespect the resources of the physical body, which the Creator
Granted.

In the list of daily aggressions against body health, you can
come across:
Tobacco addiction, under all names, encouraged here and there;
The addiction to alcoholism, which, empitating homes, temples and schools, still receives the
social applause in several areas;
The vice of gastronomy, which usually deforms the stomach, the body in general,
damaging their functions, being misinterpreted as "eating well";
The addiction of work exaggerations, subjecting organic machinery to excesses
such that in short time they consume energy and cause premature wear to the
physical body;
The addiction of overleisure, which leads the person to disrespect the law of
work, throwing itself to the opposite end, inoperability, total idleness.

They are people who all deliver or negotiate for an hour more in bed, or for
an additional holiday and other pro-paralysis arrangements, in the name of a continuous
Tiredness.

The failure of the regimes to lose weight or to gain weight, without any need
in many cases, or without the guidance of medicine and nutritionism, causing
disasters that can lead to the failure of the body vehicle.

Take care of your health, yes, without forgetting that your physical body is important
blessing at the service of his evolution on the planet, is a blessed talent that, as well as
allows you to climb the steps of the evolution you pursue.
Avoid exaggeration of any kind.

It is not allowed to suffer deficiencies and organic disorders without seeking
necessary medical care.

However, do not cultivate, the hypochondria that establishes the neurotic mania of
diseases, bombarding cells with disturbed mind darts.

Avoid the indiscriminate use of this or that medicine, however touted that
considering the harmful reactions that can cause in your body.

Take good care of your health, with all the care it requires, whether it's food
good quality and the dynamics of good gymnastics, from the necessary rests
medicines well indicated by the doctor.

So learn to do everything that is important to you in moderation, so as to
not waste the blessings of the body.

Do not forget, however, that your mental state and your psychic harmony are
to trigger their bodily resources.

So try to keep your mind fed by everything that's useful to you,
salutary, relaxing.

Acting like this, it will avoid nervous tensions, stresses, which have been so
common in today's life, provoking, with psychoemotional disorders, the
organic dysfunctions, generating diseases rather than maintaining health.

Take care of yourself, then.

Respect that blessed talent that the Creator offers you on earth.

Live your day-to-day life with this view that you are the great responsible for your
general state of disease or health, like the master of his body cells,
as you know it is.

* * *

Therefore, your soul, however, also take care of your body, an instrument
That.

To meet the needs that nature itself indicates, is to comply with the law of
god.
