We live in times when indifference and intolerance towards people,
often create situations of serious discord.

We note that respect for the next seems to be getting a little
Distant.

However, there are happy exceptions that, in addition to showing respect, in the
ensure that love for others still vices between us.

Reports a lady from the Bahian capital that a stretcher porter, in a hospital,
saw an eighty-six-year-old patient crying in pain.

His back, full of wounds, needed a special mattress.

With great affection, he provided the mattress. While the mattress was
positioned in bed, he held her in his lap.

As she cried a lot, he began to sing a song softly. The elderly woman was
settling down and fell asleep before it was even reaccommodated in bed.

This maqueiro is well known to hospital staff, for the attention and
affection with which it deals with patients.

His dedication did not go unnoticed. The director of the hospital, seeking
reward his dedication, brought together his colleagues and proposed that, with little
contribution of each one, to provide improvements in the small home of this
Server.

It was with tears in his eyes that the dedicated maqueiro thanked him for what he considered
gift. After all, he and his son slept on mattresses on the floor.

                                   *   *   *

We are energy drivers, who are driven by our feelings
positive or negative.

It is up to each one to choose how to apply this potential.

The law of cause and effect explains that of everything we plant, we will reap.

So if we cast shadows, in the shadows we will be.

If we spread light, enlightened we will be.

The universe is fair to everyone. Who chooses what they want to plant and harvest, we are
Ourselves.

We are lords of our destinies.

Goodness exists and love is the food of souls.

It is necessary to be good and love without distinction to reap these blessings.

We are endowed with free will, that is, the freedom to decide, to make
our choices.

Being free to decide, it is up to us to choose the seeds we want
cultivar.

Of course, when we do something useful, of good, we should not wait for
Reward. This should be natural, spontaneous movements to us.

However, a gesture of affection, a dialogue, a well-directed phrase are
seeds we spread.

A word of encouragement, encouragement, hope, can revere the soul
that listens to her.

A song performed with love, next to an attentive ear in moments of pain,
can change the lives of those who receive it.

As sowing is free, but harvesting is mandatory, we can wait, in the
paths of life, the harvest compatible with the seed launched.

Let us know how to choose the seeds that will bring us a harvest of peace, joys and
spiritual fulfillment.

Let us sow good with the same naturalness as we breathe the pure air of nature.

Let us do to the other what we would like to be done to us and, for sure,
we will reap of the good we will spread, whether in favors, gifts of attention that we
addressed.

Or we can simply enjoy the air of blessings that will involve us.

Let's think about it.
