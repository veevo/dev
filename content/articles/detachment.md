We live in a time of celebrities, easy appeals to wealth, consumerism,
overwhelming passions. We move around a world where the highlight will
for the one who has the most.

And at all times television commercials, ads in magazines and
newspapers, billboards cry out: Buy more. Watch more. Have more and better
Things.

It is a world in which luxury, physical beauty, ostentation and vanity have gained such space
that dominate the judgments.

It measures the importance of people by the quality of their shoes, clothes and
Bags.

More attention is paid to what has the most refined house or situated in the neighborhoods
most famous and rich.

Good cars only those with the most accessories and impress because they are beautiful,
expensive and new. Always very young.

Teenagers do not wish to repeat clothes and despise products other than
Designer. Women buy all the novelties in cosmetics. Men rejoice
with the expensive suits of the showcases.

We finally become slaves to objects. Objects of desire that dominate our
that permeate our lives, which consume our monetary resources.

And how do we react? Are we doing something – in practice – to fight
this state of affairs?

However, the great source of our human tragedy is in desires. If
overcome the desire to have things, we have walked many steps on the road of the
moral progress.

Try looking at the windows of a mall. Take a good look at the shoes, clothes,
jewelry, chocolates, handbags, ornaments, perfumes.

For a moment only, don't be seduced. Try to see all this just like
are: objects.

And say to yourself, I don't have it, but I'm still happy. I don't depend on
of none of this to be happy.

Remember: it is by wishing such things, without being able to have them, that many choose the
Crime. Take over things that are not yours, seduced by the passenger glow
of material things.

Leave behind people suffering, people who worked hard to
Save...

They leave behind you frustration, unhappiness, revolt.

But there are also those who fixate on people. They see others as something to be
possessed, guarded, locked, unshared.

These enslave themselves to partners, children, friends and relatives. Require
exclusivity, generate crises and conflicts.

They manifest, at all times, possessivity and insecurity. They extract selfishness and not
allow the other to express themselves or be loved by others.

It is, once again, desire guiding life, reducing people to tyrants,
entangled souls.

Finally, there are those who let themselves be sickly clinging to situations.

A position, a status, a profession, a relationship, a talent that brings
Highlighted. It's enough to let themselves be dragged by the transient.

These love the brilliance, applause or what they consider fame, power, glory.

For them, it's hard to say goodbye to that moment when they cease to be people
and are now noticed, commented, envied.

What's the secret to freeing yourself from all this? The word is detachment. But... As
reach you in this world?

For the constant reminder that all things are fleeting in this life. Or
be: to avoid suffering, the recipe is the overcoming of desires.

In practice, it works like this: think that situations pass, objects break,
clothes and shoes are worn out.

Even people pass, because they travel, separate from us, die...

And we must be prepared for these eventualities. It's the dynamics of life.

Thinking in this way, gradually, the creature promotes a self-education that
teaches you to always seek the best, but without generating any selfish attachment.

That is, love without demanding anything in return.
