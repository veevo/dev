Our mind is like a house. It can be grand or small, dirty or
carefully clean. It's up to us.

Have you ever seen how we act on the thoughts we cultivate?

In general, we do not have with our minds the care that we usually dispense with the
environments in which we live or work.

Who would think of leaving their house or office full of dirt, accumulating
garbage or taken by rats and insects?

Certainly no one.

However, with the mental home we are less considerate. It's just that we allow
unhappy thoughts and bad feelings find abode in our hearts.

And how do we do that?

We act like this when we allow them to have free access to our minds the
thoughts of revolt, envy, jealousy, hatred.

Or when we cultivate a desire for revenge, grudge and unhappiness.

In these moments, it's like we fill our minds with dirt. A heavy layer of
powder covers joy and prevents us from being at peace.

In addition to the anguish it brings, the tormented mind directly influences the body,
causing unnecessary illness and suffering.

Worse, it contributes to isolation.

Yes, because people realize when we are not well spiritually.

The sourness of our words, the face contracted, everything causes others to
wish to turn away from us, aggravating our unhappiness.

And what to do to keep that from happening?

The answer was given by Jesus: Pray and watch over.

Vigilance is essential for those who want a healthy mind.

Our task is to observe every thought that infiltrates, analyze nature
of the feelings that arise.

And mostly be alert to pluck like weed everything that
can harm us.

Given this first step that is surveillance, it is very important to be aware
for Jesus' second recommendation: prayer.

When we identify within us the ugly feelings, bad words and
unbalanced thoughts, we can always resort to prayer.

Prayer is a cry for help that we address to the Divine Father. When we feel
to combat unhappy thoughts, it is time to ask God for help.

It is time to speak to Him about the weakness we carry or the sadness that we
Slaughter. It's time to ask for moral force.

And the Father of Heaven will send us the necessary help.

But... on our part, it is important that there is no accommodation. You have to work
to be worthy of the help God sends us.

How to do that? Opposing every bad thought the various antidotes that
we have at our disposal: good attitudes, smile, joy, good
Readings.

Instead of malevolence, the good word, healthy conversations.

In place of acid criticism, opt for praise or constructive observation.

If an unfortunate thought arises, fight it firmly.

*   *   *

Don't be enslaved.

If anyone offends you or harms you, try to forgive, forget it. And ask God to
opportunity to be useful to that person.

Don't forget: every day is excellent opportunity to start cleaning the house
Mental. Start right now.
