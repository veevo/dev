Forgiveness poem

Seventy times seven times... Those numbers were resonating in Simon's soul
Peter for some time, after the brief colloquium with the Master.

How many times should we forgive? Are there limits to forgiveness?

Perhaps many of us have in our hearts the anguish that the Apostle had.

However, Peter's conversation with Jesus on the important theme would not end
ali.

When night dressed as balouçantes stars, stuck in the dome of the
in particular conference, Simon again questioned:

"And if someone, with whom we do not sympathize, hurt us for no reason, it will be
lawful reaction, presenting it to the judge?"

"No, Peter. Anyone who attacks, with or without reason, is assaulted in
himself."

"This, however," insisted Peter , "will not mean supporting violence and
allow the wicked to dominate the simple and the humble?

"Not at all. The bad guys are sick. Bearers of destructive torments
in the imo of themselves. To fight back them the offense is to increase their ability to
Aggression.

Only love, anointed with selflessness, manages to infuse the real transformation
within someone and demonstrate the greatness of peace to those who lost it."

"And if of pure and simple aggression, he will leave to take into his hands
the life of a loved one slaughtering him?"

"Still there" - redargui Jesus - "forgiveness assumes a preponderant role,
because the more important the challenge of love presents us, the more serious the
and difficult is the situation that leads us to forgive."

"Master!" - proposed the companion with his eyes cloudy - "To know that a vandal
withdrew from our way, by violence, son, wife or mother and not
fight back, does it mean supporting and legitimizing the right of force?"

"Simon" - answered the Master, sweetly -- "the Father established laws from which
no one can escape. We don't ask the question here in terms of forgetfulness
liability or disrespect for established legal codes. I mean
to return, hatred, to the collection plan, by those who have been
affected by the aggressive illness of the neighbor.

Besides them do not run away from consciousness, which will not forget them in court of themselves
it is up to us to allow specialised bodies to comply with their
Assignments.

We, however, will remain confident that nothing happens other than for the
will of the Father.

So we don't tease anyone or anyone else. We silence the offenses
and we dispense with mercy everywhere and with all those with whom
we live together."

"Master! What if they kill us?" - Proposed the sincere Apostle with his voice missing by the
Emotion.

"We will live, Simon. Nobody kills life. We will continue to live as much as the
criminal will also live. Never forget that the position of victim is always
the best, the happiest.

Whoever others hurt, it hurts itself. Who to others congratulates, to you
even destroys itself in the field of emotion, with the difference that the one who,
apparently, it is the loser, if loving and forgiving, will be exempt from any
afflictions and will therefore be unattained."

                                   *   *   *

Always forgive. Let's remember that. Always forgive.
