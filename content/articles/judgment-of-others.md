Famous are the judgments of history. The one from Nuremberg, which the whole world
accompanied, opining for the punishment of those who, savagely, during the Second
World War II, they had tortured and killed human beings.

That of Jesus, in which injustice is verified by shouting loudly and overcoming the good
sense of justice and truth.

Trials of famous people who have committed criminal acts or landslides.

Trials of criminals that somehow involved famous people,
as the case of lindenberg's son's kidnapper.

In such processes, public opinion always ignites and, in some way,
influences the jurors themselves, so that they condemn or absolve.

From the early ages, when the tenuous flame of thought of justice
lit up on the man, he began to judge his brothers.

Often, the feeling of justice was empanated by passions and interests
petty, leading man to make mistakes, punishing his fellow with the
the confiscation of property and death.

Nowadays, we continue to judge the fellow with all rigor, without
establish basic criteria and principles.

Afoitos, we opine and give our sentence as soon as the press makes public the
conduct of this or that creature, though unaware of details and reasons.

And we fear not increasing the intensity of the misconduct, even for
justify the wickedness with which we judge and the judgment we have delivered.

Sometimes envy for failing to achieve the social position, the position
or the function of the trial, further encourages us to arbitrary judgment.

And yet we continue to assert ourselves Christians. Followers of Jesus who
Taught:

Do not judge not to be judged, for you will be judged as
there have been judged the others.

There is a need to cultivate indulgence and empathy. The indulgence for
let's look at those who make mistakes with the eyes of who knows that the mistaken is always a
Sick spirit.

It does not need our cold judgment, but our assistance to overcome your
Problem.

Empathy in order to stand in the place of what we judge and
ask if we were judged them, how would we feel?

That was our son judged him, how would our heart be?

The question of judgment seems easy to us, because those brought to the bar
court's numbers are just numbers. We don't even remember that they are beings
Human.

But they are immortal spirits, just like us, and deserve to receive justice, not
wickedness or the burden of our frustrations.

                                   *   *   *

The authority to censor is in the direct reason of the morality of the one who
Censorship.

In God's eyes, the only legitimate authority is that based on the example of the
Well.

The basis of Divine Justice is based on the mercy of our Creator Father.

That is why He grants us reincarnation as a blessed opportunity
repair of our faults, at the time it allows us to grow and produce in the
Well.
