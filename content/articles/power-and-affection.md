The lack of tact to resolve conflicts and deal with issues with people who
have opposing ideas has been responsible for many disagreements and
displeasures in relationships.

Sometimes a problem that could be easily solved creates serious
disruptions because of the lack of way of antagonists.

Affection, used wisely is a powerful tool, but little used by the
most individuals.

The most common has been violence, aggressiveness, intolerance.

There are people who don't like to show their intimacy and hide under a
veil of sisudez, with airs of few friends, in an attempt to avoid approximations
to put their weaknesses exposed.

They are like snails, armabes, turtles and similar ones.

When they feel threatened, they hide in their natural shells, and leave no
show none of its vulnerable parts.

By the way, have you ever tried to forcibly remove from your hiding place, a
of those little animals?

It would be a failed attempt unless you don't mind tearing the
your opponent's body.

In the case of the turtle, for example, the more you try, with violence,
remove it from the hull, the more it will shrink to survive.

But if you put her in a cozy, warm place that inspires confidence,
she will leave naturally.

So it also happens to humans. If, instead of strength, the
affection, warmth, tenderness, naturally disarming person and leaves
Involved.

Sometimes the person arrives prevented against everything and against everyone and disarms himself to the
simple contact with a frank smile or an affectionate embrace.

But if instead you find people also predisposed to aggression,
conflict, things get even worse.

How living with other individuals is a reality of which we cannot
escape, we need to learn to deal with each other wisely and without
Wear.

The force has never been and will never be the best alternative, besides causing serious
damage to the life of relationship.

Therefore, creating harmonic relationships is an art that needs to be cultivated
and taken seriously.

But for that you need at least one of the parties to want it and do it.

And if one of the parties wants, as much as the other is coated with a
protection similar to that of a porcupine, no one will leave injured and the
relationship will succeed.

Just remember this rule very simple, but effective: instead of strength, affection. And
everything is resolved without wear.

                                   *   *   *

Of everything we do in life are just a few lessons:

The certainty that we are all in the process of learning...

The conviction we need from each other...

I'm sure we can't stop the step...

Trust in the power of renewal of the human being.

Therefore, we must take advantage of adversity to cultivate virtues.

Make the stumbles a dance step.

Fear a challenge.

From the opponents, friends.

And withdraw, under all circumstances, lessons to be happy.
