What's the secret to a happy marriage?

Every relationship is challenging. The more intimate you do, the more dedication in
Requires.

Thus, life for two, sharing our existence with others, demands
commitment and attention.

However, it will be possible to understand the best virtues to build a
happy marriage?

If the initial passion, and soon after love, are indispensable factors,
will there be other values that need to permeate the relationship?

Thinking about it, two American psychologists, John and Julie Gottman, made a
study with couples to understand the success or failure of a marriage.

They analyzed the behavior of one hundred and thirty couples, as they related,
how they reacted to each other, in common attitudes, such as cooking, cleaning the house,
dine.

Based on their perceptions, the researchers ranked couples in two
basic groups.

Six years later, psychologists have re-examined the same couples.

They realized that those belonging to the first group remained married and happy.

However, those who were classified in the second group, or were separated,
or remained together, however, unhappy.

By analyzing the causes of success of the first group, the Gottman couple realized
virtues preponderad in the lives of these couples: the goodness and
Generosity.

Psychologists realized that, in the long run, it becomes fundamental and
significant than in daily actions, even in the most common place, the
generosity and kindness are present.

For example, the wife is late for a commitment because she spent time
bigger getting ready.

Her husband's reaction may be to fight, grumble and complain that she always
is late, which can never meet schedules.

Or he may perceive in this a zeal and care of her to present himself in his
company, in a special way and in the best way.

If the husband goes to the supermarket and forgets to buy some items, bringing
half of the related, the wife can complain, say that he does not value the
things of the house, call it distracted and careless.

Or she can thank you for going to the supermarket, and just redo the
list with what was missing.

They are in the details, in the short observations, in the answers to the most
that we can feed the relationship with demonstrations of generosity and
of love.

As a lubricant to facilitate the movement of gears, these feelings
allow life to two to gain depth and solidity.

So in the name of the marriage we elected to us, let's look at how much kindness
and generosity we have towards our spouse.

In the face of the harsh response, let us use the goodness of the word soft and
Understanding.

We replace severe and rigid judgment, often already worn by the
time, by the generosity of those who perceive and recognize values in whom we
Accompanies.

Let's think about those details.
