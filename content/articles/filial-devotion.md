There are examples throughout history that speak of love and extreme
filial dedication.

We remember a Roman legend from the final times of the Republic. Many were
unfair persecution of the old servants of that regime. After all, the Empire
was about to emerge.

The rulers of Rome even decree that old servants of the Republic
banned from the city.

Among these, there was an old patient. Now, he gets sick simply serving the
Rome, which i loved so much.

For this reason he decided, despite his son's insistence, that he would not leave the
City.

Old man was, he thought. And sick. If you should wait for death, why do it
away from the lands he loved so much and that he had served, with total dedication?
I'd rather die in your own bed.

The night of the last day that was allowed to stay. If it were
caught inside the walls of Rome after the deadline, would be killed.

The son again insisted that his father be saved.

I know you can't even walk, my father. But I'll carry him. Let me take care of
from you. I will gather all my strength to get him out of town.

So much insisted that dad eventually gave in. The boy carried the precious cargo to the
and followed through the streets of Rome.

The crowd was crammed to see the incredible scene, and in the face of their son's efforts,
applauds, encouraging him.

The powerful just looked. In a way, they moved and decided not to
Interfere.

The time was approaching when the old man would be killed if he were found inside the
city walls and the distance was still great that separated the two from the gate.

The forces were almost over. The boy bowed before the burden of the burden. Same
so advanced, slowly, slow. And the crowd applauded.

He managed to get out of town in the last moments of the deadline. However, the old consul
I wasn't safe yet. You had to leave the Roman lands.

Covered by the shadows of the night, Appius carried his father to the beach, where
embarked on other lands, safely.

So that this gesture of filial love would never be forgotten, he was inscribed in the
of the almost extinct Roman Republic.

                                   *   *   *

The commandment Honors your father and mother means much more than
respect those who gave their lives to their children.

I mean also assist them in need and provide them with rest in the
Age. Surround them with care as they did with the little ones in the period of
Childhood.

This duty naturally extends to people who sometimes do father and
mother, whom they have so much greater merit, for harboring the children of others in their
breasts, feeding them with their love and affection.

Children owe parents not only the strictly necessary, they should also
little superfluous nothings, kind care, the sweetness which, in the end,
are nothing more than just the return of what they received in their childhood and
Youth.

This is the true meaning of the Decalogue's commandment.
