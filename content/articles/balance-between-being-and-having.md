We live in a world that greatly values material goods. In his
majority, people value or not the next, from what the other has
and appears, not by the essence of his being.

In a world dominated by materialistic nations and still unreached
sufficient spiritual development, most people dedicate their lives
to accumulate money and material goods.

From an early age, the kids get used to having what they want. And they start to value
your friends for their appearances.

What happens is that, without sufficient moral reserves, many become
true slaves of material possession and often enslave others to
achieve their goals.

Undoubtedly, material possessions are a socio-economic achievement of being
throughout his numerous journeys on Earth.

The material development of societies is important because it generates improvements in
quality of life, encourages the development of industry, trade,
sciences, the arts.

All these achievements allow humanity to overcome obstacles of
basic survival and, with this, the possibility of developing its side
spiritual and moral.

The achievement of having is everyone's duty. The family depends on the material resources
development, as well as society.

The achievement of having, however, should never be more important than that of being, which
it is the conquest of moral values and leads the individual to rise as a Spirit.

The risk of ownership or ownership is not in the fact itself, but of the
way this is and what it represents emotionally.

The acquisition of material goods should not be based on avarice, and as an objective
the conquest of a social position that can be envied or submitted by others.

Material conquest must be the result of decent and constant work,
often from a profession based on study and preparation.

Material conquest must provide comfort and balance to those who have it,
but never lead to the imbalance of superfluous possessions and the way of life of
endless ostentation and pleasures.

Who accumulates material goods in a quantity greater than that required than their
dignity as well as his family, has a moral obligation: to share his assets
in an intelligent and sensible way.

Obviously the donation to those who need is necessary and noble, but the
real division is based on job creation and development.

To have such lucidity it is necessary that the individual already has greater evolution
spiritual so that you can realize that it serves a cumulative fortune
financial institutions and transformed only into goods of their own use.

It is necessary to have balance, we need to think about the next, it is necessary to be more of the
that have.

Happiness on earth depends on what is being had, but is what the
be cultivates inwardly in terms of sincere, unlimited love and in
Simplicity.
