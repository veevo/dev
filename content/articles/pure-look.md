In his famous Sermon on the Mountain, Jesus stated that the singing of the body are the
Eyes.

He also said that if the eyes are good, the whole body will have light.

But if they're bad, the whole body will be clover.

The candeia was a utensil used for lighting.

It should be placed in a high and prominent place, so that its light may become
shuns in the distance.

Depending on popular ancient sayings, the eyes are the window or mirror of the
Soul.

These adagios reveal the important correlation between the eyes and the
essence of the creature.

Ordinary, it is preferably for them that the human being perceives the reality
that surrounds him.

From this perception, it orders your feeling and its proceed.

What he focuses on, what he chooses as important to pay attention, sets the tone
of his living.

As Jesus said, if the eyes are good, the whole body is luminous.

The world is rich in distractions.

Without a firm orientation, it is possible to get lost in them and become a futile someone.

Soap operas and TV series, Internet and magazines are just some of the hobbies to
Disposal.

They have nothing intrinsically wrong, but do not constitute the objective of
Existence.

Precisely for this, they cannot consume excessive time.

The Spirit does not take a body of flesh to be distracted, but to
Perfect.

The best-enjoyed time is the one spent on intellectual and moral fraud.

In instructive conversations, in the warmth of the family, with friends of the heart.

Or in learning a language, meditating on a text of morals or
Philosophy.

Dedication to a cause also has great value, the attention given to people
needy or sick.

However, it is not only with the excess of distractions that one should be cautious.

Worse than spending time on banalities is fixing attention to things
deleterious.

A time of great permissiveness is lived on Earth and the discourse that
almost everything is normal.

So it may not seem shocking to like porn, keep conversations
or stay awake on account of night-stays.

But care must be taken with what the look is properly fixed, not to
compromise one's own dignity.

The taste for rot, even if socially accepted, comforts the essence of the
Be.

In order not to have a clover body, as the gospel say, it is important to have good
Eyes.

That is, focus attention on what is beautiful and pure in the world.

Take taste for conversations and sound readings.

Spend your own time on constructive activities and devote yourself to social works.

The result of this option for good will be a beautiful light that will wear all being.

Let's think about it.
