Business posture hurts the Ten Commandments.

It was to this conclusion that the professor of Graduate Studies and Marketing, Marcelo
Peruzzo arrived after conducting serious research with hundreds of executives
Brazilian.

But after all, what the Ten Commandments and business administration
have in common?

Everything, in Professor Peruzzo's opinion.

He did a survey with Brazilian executives to check if they
the commandments in the daily lives of companies. Of the total number of respondents,
seventy-one percent said they believed in the divine rules, but,
contradictorily, most do not comply with them.

The teacher's research has a reliability degree of ninety-five per
Hundred. According to him, entrepreneurs who practice organizational sins
risk of disappearing from the market.

This has already happened to people who coveted the next market, wanted to grow
very fast and broke.

The first commandment – Loving God over all things — is disrespected
for at least fifty-four percent of respondents, who
confessed to putting money above all things, thus committing the
that the expert calls the first organizational sin.

Lying is practical among sixty-one percent of respondents, who
admit to promising things they do not comply, disrespecting, according to the analogy of the
teacher, the commandment that The name of God should not be pronounced
in vain.

The rest period is not respected by forty-three percent of
executives, who work day and night, including on weekends and holidays,
relegating everything on behalf of the company.

Professor Peruzzo also considers that fifty-three percent of
respondents do not respect the fourth commandment - Honor ing father and mother , because
forget family and friends for total dedication to the organization.

The fifth divine rule, which determines that the Christian should not kill, would be
being disrespected by forty-six percent.

This organizational sin can mean killing the client by offering a
poor quality service; kill the competition, which is important for
drive the organization's own growth; and kill society, not
assuming proper social responsibility.

Betrayal is a common practice between thirty-eight percent of respondents,
who begin to maintain relationships with employees or co-workers,
due to the distancing of family and love.

More than half of respondents, fifty-two percent, confessed
practice the seventh organizational sin, equivalent to Not stealing: making
transactions in which there is no fair exchange, causing injury to the
to the other part.

A very significant percentage of sixty-four percent of executives
responded that forges policies for his own benefit, conspiring, gossiping, with
envy and greed, and don't mind harming the next to get
Advantage.

This kind of attitude plays the eighth commandment that establishes: No
you will bear false testimony against your neighbor.

Twenty-seven percent of executives said they use power and persuasion
to seduce colleagues or subordinates, contrary to the ninth commandment.

Leaving aside the tenth commandment - You will not covet anything that belongs
to your neighbor – thirty-seven percent of executives admit as a goal
of the company only profit and market achievement, coveting the space of the
competitors.

                                   *   *   *

Perhaps you, as a businessman, think that God does not have to get involved in the
men's business and that His commandments should be served only by the
Religious.

However, if you consider that God is the true owner of everything and that you are a
mere administrator, then will try to look at the business world in a way that
Different.

But if you are a Christian, your commitment is even greater, for it was the Christ who
stated that all of us will one day be called by the Divine Laws to give accounts
of our administration.

Think about it!
