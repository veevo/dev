It is said that when Ignatius of Antioch was arrested, he was taken to Rome and placed
in an underground, where he met friends of faith.

There he remembered Jesus and, for several hours, spoke to them about the
beatitudes of the kingdom of God.

A week later, thousands of spectators crowded the circus and the arena filled up
of beasts coming from various parts of the world.

They hadn't been fed for a week. To sharpen their taste buds,
bloody pieces of flesh were thrown at them.

In that arena, Christians were cast and the animals quickly
shattered the fragile bodies of elders, men, women and children, who did not
intimidated themselves in the face of death.

However, in a strange way, Ignatius, who was among them, was not
Touched. He waited for a paw in his chest to tear his bones apart and the
Muscles. However, no beast broke his body.

Seeing that the corpses of his companions were already being rejected by the
sated beasts, he knelt in the bloodied arena and prayed to Jesus: Why?
Why was I spared? Why didn't I have the honor of dying?

Then a spiritual being presented himself to psychic vision and answered him:
Ignatius, dying is very easy. Losing the body at once is a testimony
small for you. You, who love Jesus so much, deserve something more painful. You
Live. You will live among people who don't understand you, who will be suspicious of you.

Being firm in the ideal, Ignatius, at the time of difficulties, this is the sacrifice
Greater. The Master wishes you to live, that His message will come out of your mouth and
experience continued persecution without discouragement. Death in the arena is a
death very quickly for those who are good and faithful.

Ignatius had his life spared. Christians assumed that he had denied the
Christ and sacrifice to the gods of Rome to save himself.

Slander, malevolence and intrigue sowed in the Christian community all sorts
of mistrust.

He has never defended himself, because those who love Jesus have no time to waste with
unproductive defenses.

He never justified himself, because he should be accountable to his king, Jesus, and
not to his peers, subjects like him.

I didn't say a word. The years have shown their greatness. He would become
the model of the true Christian, the model of that primitive servant of Jesus,
elevated to the category of blessed, by his witness of love.

                                   *  *  * 

If we serve Jesus, let us not be disturbed by the quarrels that surround us with the
Actions.

We always answer with love. We served without tiredness. Let us work and, as the Apostle
of Antioch, we have given account of our acts to Jesus, our Master and Lord.

We live every day in good, applying full charity which is benevolence towards
all, indulgence for the imperfections of others and forgiveness of offenses.
