For a minute, close your eyes and think about what you want...

What if you found out that the time you have left is just another minute? Exact
sixty seconds: no more, no less.

It would be certain that, when i became aware of this fact, things would change
Dimension.

The money, once indispensable, at that moment would become insignificant. And
not all the wealth of the world would be able to change this picture.

The accumulated old sorrows, frustrations, so many disappointments,
daily complaints, in the face of such a peculiar situation, would become empty,
almost meaningless.

The family fights, the stubbornness of her husband, the impatience of his wife, the
disobedience of the children in that final minute, rather than causing irritation,
would bring a sense of nostalgia and longing.

On the other hand, simple things, the small gestures that demonstrate
affection, affection, kindness, would be infinitely magnied, in this
last minute.

A kiss, a tight hug, a declaration of love, an exchange of glances, a
apology would become what is most precious in the world.

A touch, a smile, hands that meet, a sincere I love you: the treasures
hidden behind simplicity.

Have you ever stopped to think about how much can be done in a minute? Or
better, have you ever stopped a minute to think?

Without a doubt, you can't do everything you want in sixty seconds. But
one minute is enough time to move everything forever.

One minute is the time required to choose between the offense and forgiveness, between the
hatred and love, between violence and peace.

It is necessary for us to declare our love for someone, to offer bread to
who is hungry, comfort to those who have given up hope, to share a
Smile.

In just a minute we can cherish hearts, take joy, write
a tenderness note to someone special.

One minute is enough to radiate light to our family members, to our
friends, to those who have gone into eternity, to those who go through the tests
through prayer.

One minute is more than enough time to be happy.

Did you allow yourself to be happy at this very minute?

Let go of the regrets of the past. Focus on the present, as it is in the
we readjust the bad choices of the past and build the future.

Believe in the strength of forgiveness. Remember that we are all walkers of
road of progress and that we now settle, sometimes we are wrong in our
Choices. Be patient with the faults of those of the other people as you have with your
failures themselves.

Have faith, hope and charity as its north. So no matter how dark
make the night, your steps will always lead you towards happiness, love and
Peace.

Allow yourself to renew: it takes a minute, no more than a minute.

Think about it. Enjoy the next minute.
