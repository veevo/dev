Who of us hasn't been through a bad time in our lives?

Unexpected moments that appear to threaten the best buildings of the
our walk.

In these moments, our nervous organization lets itself be displeasured, causing
unpredictable reactions.

We discovered unknown content in ourselves.

That's what happened to Vanessa that afternoon.

She, who had always seemed calm and balanced, allowed herself to be involved in the
depth of suffering, in the face of alarming news.

On the phone, she was told of a serious accident that occurred with her husband. And
request for his urgent presence in the municipal hospital.

The impact seemed to get the ground off his feet. I didn't know what to do first:
call a cab? Drive your own car? Ask someone to accompany you?

And he started talking, non-stop, cursing his luck.

When, finally, he arrived at the hospital and knew that her husband had not resisted, given
the deep injuries suffered, everything worsened.

I wanted to know who was to blame, who had been the irresponsible cause of the
accident, who would take steps to punish that person.

He misled God and the world for not conforming to the situation of loss that
suffered.

It has become so inconvenient that it caused problems for those who
found in the same place. Finally, there was such a nervous crisis, which had to be
and properly medicated.

                                    *  *  *

Negative feelings only make the special moments we need worse
Face.

When our sensitivity is in imbalance, we only increase the
Problems.

The inaccurate or thoughtless view of certain facts makes us see them as
Invincible.

This mistaken view of the event, fueled by unhappy feelings
that we bring in our hearts favors the stretching of the unfortunate moment.

The noble feelings conquered and experienced throughout our lives
will help to face what comes to us, with a little calm.

Even because problems are not solved in confusion, neither impatience nor impatience or
in the screaming.

In fact, they require us weighting, calm to try to find the best
solution, or take the action that is the right, as the case may be
Present.

If we have the habit of prayer, it will help us stay balanced,
unexpected facts that happen to us.

The bad moment goes by like everything goes on in our lives.

What stays is our personal way of facing the evidence to which we are
Submitted.

Moral tests, disenchantments, loss of loved ones, disappointments and
disappointments leave their marks on us.

When positive, they will make us stronger, more experienced.

Knowing how to extract the lesson from the bad moment is that it makes a difference for each of us.

It would be good if from an early age we learned to see life with more understanding,
to suffer less.

Let us note that disappointments are opportunities to practice our strength of
will, humility and overcoming.

What good feelings, patience, knowledge and sincere desire to get right, in the
will bring better ways to face the bad moment that arises.

So we can turn it into blessed learning and growth time
Spiritual.

Let's think about it!
