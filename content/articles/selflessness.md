Spiritual evolution is a very complex phenomenon, which occurs in successive
Phases.

At first, body nature predominates.

Dominated by instincts, the creature devotes its time and interest to
activities eatzinhas.

Eat, dress, shelter, breed and care for offspring, behold to which they boil down
their concerns.

During this period, selfishness is striking.

The instincts for the conservation of life and the preservation of the species have absolute
Preponderance.

Over time, the being begins to detach from its origin.

Intelligence develops, reasoning is sophisticated and moral sense
Blooms.

Inventions make it possible to spend time on issues not directly linked
survival.

Living is no longer so difficult, from the material prism.

On the other hand, moral dilemmas begin.

With the reason developed, responsibility arises strong in the ways
Spiritual.

What was once admissible becomes a scandal.

Sensitivity is cleared and the creature aspires to intellectual achievements and
Affective.

This new sensitivity also shows that the next is its similar, with
equal right to be happy and fulfilled.

It is gradually evident the basic equality between all men.

Malgrad possessors of talents and diverse values, are not distinguished in the
Essential.

A divine flame animates them and will lead everyone to the greatest developments.

However, the abandonment of the quasi-poor habits of the first experiences is not easy.

Centuries are spent on the arduous task of taming addictions and passions.

Incarnations follow as the Spirit struggles to ascend.

The greatest obstacle to the liberation of painful experiences is selfishness, which
has a strong bond with attachment to bodily things.

The more it stings to material goods, the more man shows little
understand their spiritual nature.

The Spirit needs to free himself from attachment to transient things.

Just as soon as he acquires conditions to live the sublime experiences to which he is
Destined.

Those who wish to leave primitivism must combat the taste pronounced by the enjoyments
of matter.

The best way to do this is to practice selflessness.

It is a virtue characterized by detachment and
Disinterest.

Selfless action matters in overcoming the agent's selfish tendencies.

It is acts for the benefit of a cause, person or principle, without targeting any
advantage or personal interest.

It's certainly not a virtue you get to play with.

Only with discipline and determination does it incorporate into character.

But since no one will do the work of others, you have to start at some point.

Therefore, start practicing selflessness.

Strive to perform a series of attitudes focused on others.

Forget your personality and think with interest in the good of others.

This initial effort will soon bear fruit.

The taste for the transient will slowly abandon him.

He will be replaced by spiritual pleasures.

You will discover the chance of being kind, of supporting the fallen and teaching the
Ignorant.

These soft and transcendent tastes will lead you to spheres of sublime
Achievements.

Think about it.
