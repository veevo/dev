When we embrace Christian doctrine, when we dent by the reflections of the
Gospels, we feel encouraged to change our way of being.

The excitement of the first hour is great. We were excited about the prospect of
become true followers of who is the Model and Guide of Humanity,
Jesus.

We read about the challenges and victories of the early Christians and
we propose to be, like them, faithful followers of the Master of Nazareth.

Following the days, we realize that the old habits, that
all that constitutes in us the old man, speaks very loudly.

The difficulties are emerging at every step. And we almost fell into dismay at
we have seen so great the gulf between the desired theory and efficient practice.

This is something that happens to all who aspire to behavioral changes,
in view of the habits we have rooted.

Although we say Christians, it is not an easy task to follow the Master, the only being
perfect that passed the Earth.

We know his teachings, we want to adopt him as a Model of our lives,
but it seems that the mirror we serve is scratched and distorts the image.

We want to do the right things at the right times, but just there in the
we let ourselves down.

We are saddened to adopt, time or time, behaviors never
imagined to be totally inconsistent with Christian teaching.

At times when we propose to use goodness, we are surprised at
malevolence and wickedness.

When we imagine having understood the optimistic way of acting, in the world in which
we move, show signs of despair for something, a little nothing.

The Master's brotherly love thrills us, however, we are surprised
encouraging discord and separation.

We praise the simplicity of rabbi, and complicate our own lives.

In summary: we find ourselves much longer away from Christian acts than
executing them, in our daily lives.

                                   *   *   *

It is important to be aware of our steps and behaviors so as not to
Let us let ourselves down.

Let's not hope to turn into wonderful people, from a moment to the
Other. Every change requires effort, perseverance.

It is not enough to express the will to change. We need to work each other
moment, think and rethink every attitude.

If we embrace Jesus as our Model of Life, it is up to us to follow His examples
remarkable, so that the construction of our new being will materialize.

Desiring to follow His footsteps, we must walk the paths of
meekness, love and forgiveness which He exemplified.

If we choose him as a Guide, let's be careful not to get lost on the stroke
of this blessed route.

He claimed to be the Way, truth and life, and that no one goes to the Father but
by Him.

In this way, we dedicate ourselves to amá-lO, to follow lO, step by step, reformulation
every wrong attitude.

We have patience with ourselves and do not abandon the trail of renewal, which
will be done, with constancy and persistence.

Let's move on to the Top.
