Among the many good stories reported in Reader's Digest Selections, one in
drew attention to the teachings it contains.

Its author, already made man, reflecting on the power of prayer, remembers
when i was still just a little boy.

He says that one spring morning his mother dressed him in his fatigue
domingueira and recommended that it not go beyond the steps of the door of the
front for in a few minutes, they would visit his aunt.

Boy waited patiently until the neighbor's son of the corner himself
approached him and told him a swear word.

Then he jumped the steps and docked with each other until they both fell in a puddle
llama.

Her white blouse got muddy and the sock with a bloody tear at the time of the
Knee.

He remembered his mother's warning and began screaming desperately.

His pain, however, ended when he heard the noise of the ice cream maker who advertised in
your product.

Forgot disobedience and ran in order to ask mom for money to buy a
Ice cream.

He says he could never forget his mother's answer:

Look at yourself! You're in no condition to ask for anything.

It was immersed in these memories that the author drew a parallel with our
position before God, when we pray for something.

Before we invoke God's help, we need to turn our gaze to us
and check whether or not we are in a position to ask for something.

For Him to help us, we must do our part as prescribed
the Gospel: Help that Heaven will help you.

The evil of most of those who pray for blessings is that they are not honest with God.

It is common to beg heavenly graces, being of severed relationships with
family, friends, neighbors...

When we seek Divine Help we need to prepare our hearts
Properly. It is useless to ask for support with a heart full of envy, jealousy,
of malquerency, hatred and other moral debris.

In that case, if we really wish to ask for something, that we ask for the strength to win
these miseries of the soul.

It is common for us to ask God to give us health and, on the other hand, to end it
with the sick addiction of cigarettes, gluttony, unfortunate trago, night-night
among other abuses.

Important that we meditate a little more about our real willingness to
receive Divine Help, once God knows our most secret intentions.

                                   *   *   *

Before seeking help through prayer, look at yourself and see if you are in
conditions to ask for something.

Make sure you're doing the part that fits you.

If the temple of your heart is properly cleanand airy to receive the
blessings of the Creator.

Always remember the recommendation: Help yourself that Heaven will help you.

The condition is that we help each other first, doing our part, and then
deserve the help of the High.

Important that we understand well the mechanisms of prayer: to ask, know how to ask and,
above all, deserve it.
