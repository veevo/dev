All who have been cherished by paternal love, for sure, we remember our
old man with longing. Particularly when we become parents ourselves,
memories acode to the trampling.

In the acoustics of the soul, we still hear the firm steps on the nights of thunderstorms, the
check on your round, windows, locks, curtains, children's sleep.

If we close our eyes, we can feel the slide of your hand lightly by our
face and careful pull of the blanket.

We see his silhouette getting lost in the darkness and we hear the last open and close of the
Fridge.

We remembered the child we went to and who was waiting for his return from work.
Those who had parents whose work required many days outside the home, we can
feel the heart again to the trampled, remembering the sound of his car,
arriving in the early hours of the morning.

Did you remember to bring a gift? Is your beard undone and
Are you going to stick our face?

We recall the weekend, birthday gift, supper of
Christmas. Even the scolding after our rascals.

We also remember the affections upon the arrival of our newsletter, the joy after
pass the year. The family celebration for our victories: Fundamental,
High School, Entrance Exam, College.

And when did we get to adolescence? How much care! Who are your
Companions? Who are you going out with? Where are you going?

Don't smoke. Don't drink. It doesn't exceed speed. Respect traffic signs.

Is it time to arrive? Didn't I tell you to get here before midnight?

Son, respect your elders. Give your grandparents a cuddle. When, after all,
Will you decide to work?

Kid, I'm going to cut your allowance.

Looking at the wrinkles emblazoned on our father's face, we are taken with affection and
we bow before him. How many years lived in the warmth of the paternal home. How
Lessons!

Lessons we have passed on to our own children today and, without giving ourselves
account, we repeat the same gestures of it. Of the one who is sixty, seventy
years was reborn and one day became our father.

We look at our children and remind you of how our father's generosity, their
care has done us good to character, we are so sorry to care for our
own shoots.

For all this, again, is that our gratitude grows on the chest and explodes in
a great manifestation of affection. And, as if our father were a child
little, we embrace dwelled the old man and packed him in our arms, with the same song
of lullaby that one day he cradled our childhood.

                                   *   *   *

The messages passed on to children shut down deeply in their souls. Although the
time, distance, the most adverse circumstances, all that has snared them and
encouraged in the children's years to resonate with life.

This is why childhood has a character of paramount importance to the human being. Right
in this rest period for the Spirit, which prepares for the struggles of the
world, that being is supplied with energies, vigor, real values that are, in
truth, the only authentic inheritances that parents bequeathe to their children.
