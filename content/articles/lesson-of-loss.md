What would we do if, suddenly, by some circumstances, we had in the
the possibility of deciding on the fate of a person who
caused a lot of problems?

Someone who extended the robe of slander and destroyed our good name before the
Friends. Someone who took over the company, the fruit of our labor of so many years.

Someone who brutally hurt a member of our family.

Would we remember the lesson of forgiveness taught by Jesus? Would they come to
our mind the words of Master Galileo: Blessed are the merciful,
why will they achieve mercy?

Or, furthermore, the exhortation about reconciling ourselves as soon as possible
possible with our opponent?

By the way, it is said that a slave has become of great value for his
sir, because of your honor and good behavior.

As a result, it has been elevated to a position of importance as a
administrator of their farms.

On one occasion, you wished to buy twenty more slaves. They went together to
and the administrator was tasked with observing and choosing.

They should, of course, be strong men, so that they could perform well the
rude tasks on farms.

The administrator went to the market and began his search. At one point, it set the
seen in an old and decrepit slave. Pointing it at your master, I told you
that that should be one of those that should be acquired.

The farmer was surprised by the choice and did not agree. Listening to the
dialogue, the slave trader said that if twenty men were bought,
he'd give the old man for free.

After the negotiation, they were all taken to one of the properties.

The administrator began to treat the old man with greater care and attention than the
any of the others.

He took him to his house. I'd give him his food. When it was cold, I'd take him to
when it was hot, i'd put it under the cocoa trees in the shade.

Admired of those attentions given to a slave, you asked why
he did it that way.

I'm sure there should be some special reason: Is it your relative, maybe your father?

The answer was negative.

Is that your big brother?

Not either, he answered.

Is that your uncle or another relative?

I have no kinship with him. He's not even my friend.

So, the farmer asked, why are you so interested in him?

He's my enemy, sir. He sold me to a dealer and that's how I became
escravo.

But I have learned, in the teachings of Jesus, that we must forgive our
Enemies. This is the opportunity to exercise my learning.

                                   *   *   *

Forgiveness soothes and blesses your donor.

The greater the happiness of those who express forgiveness. The pardon is someone in process
recovery. However, he who dispenses with him forgetting evil,
has reached the heights of good and solidarity.

When we understand that forgiving is gaining ennoblement, we will make ourselves strong
for the concessions of love and understanding that we are able to distribute.
