Adults usually don't read comic books but some of them bring
deep teachings, in a playful and intelligent way.

With well-made designs and vivid colors, the characters created by the artists
are passing philosophy lessons and important concepts for the formation of a
more conscious generation.

Sometimes on a single page we find great lessons.

And one of these begins with the character named Horace, a small dinosaur
green, which walks through the rocks and suddenly sees himself before a great
Mirror.

Look at your reflected image before you, and something catches your eye.

After an attentive observation, exclaim to yourself: Little legs...

Look more closely and think: Tiny little arms!

One more look and realizes: Bulging eyes and a huge head!

It is observed a little more and then goes, happy of life, thinking to you
Same:

Oh, it's okay! It must be one of those mirrors that deform us!

We also constantly come across the mirror of our own
conscience, which not only points out our moral deformities, but also indicates the
better conduct we should adopt.

When it is not the mirror of consciousness, it is the people who live with us who
we're told about our flaws.

However, many of us do as Horace. We turn our backs and say that the
deformity is the fault of the mirror.

When the consciousness alerts us about the envy that entangles our image, we
we apologize that the other has no right or deserving and that we were
depreced by divinity.

If jealousy projects a deformed image and the intimate mirror marks us the
problem we say it's over-love or well-wanting, and that we have the right to
require exclusive possession.

If avarice shows its distorted face in our intimate mirror, conformed,
we console ourselves: I am only economical and foresight!

When pride trumpets its sovereignty, and consciousness makes the alert, the
excuse arises immediately: In me there is only dignity!

But if our moral deformities are pointed out by others, which are our
external mirrors, we say that this is nothing but envy, jealousy, spite...

There is no doubt that self-deception is a reality and occurs at the level
unconscious but there are ways to check whether or not our conduct is
Wrong.

There is also no doubt that self-knowledge is the key to progress
individual.

For those who really want to know themselves, to make moral reform
necessary for eternal happiness, here are some tips from the great philosopher Saint
Augustine:

When you are undecided about the value of one of your actions, ask how the
would qualify if it were practiced by another person.

If you censor you noutrem, you may not have it legitimate when you are your author,
for God does not use two measures in the application of His righteousness.

Also try to know what their fellow people think of her and not despise the
opinion of his enemies.

Enemies have no interest in masking the truth and God often
puts at your side like a mirror in order to be warned with more
frankness of what a friend would do.

Anyone who feels possessed of the serious desire to improve himself in order to
extirpar of himself the bad pendores, as from his garden plucks the weeds,
you must ask your conscience always and without fear of hearing it.

It is only fair that you spend a few minutes to conquer eternal happiness.

We do not work every day with the aim of joining thereres that guarantee us
rest in old age, which is usually full of pain and suffering?

It will certainly be worth investing a few more efforts to win the
endless happiness.

Let's think about it!
