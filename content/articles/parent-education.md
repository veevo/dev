In an international circulation magazine, we read that a lady went to the theater
with his two children.

She narrates that as soon as the show began, two other children who were
seated later in front began to cry, in loud cries.

A spectator who was close, told their mother: It would not be better to
lady go out with both of them until they calm down? I take care of your seats.

More than quickly, the woman replied, "Of course I'm not leaving. I bought three
Tickets. My daughters and I have the right to stay until the end of the show.
The others who hold on.

These are facts of such a nature that we are told why the bad education of so many
children and young people, nowadays.

It's just that your parents don't set standards. Exactly because they themselves don't have
Standards.

And for many parents, their children are always right. If the kid stayed on the bench
reservations in the school game, depart vigorously upon the coach, wishing
know the reasons of what they call free pursuit.

With such an attitude, they do not exemplify the child that there is time to participate
actively and time to wait, observe.

That a team is the result of the effort of each and every one at the moment
Timely.

If the junior team loses, here are again the parents blaming the coach, the coach.
After all, everyone has a bad will with their children, they don't prepare them.

At no point do you consider telling their son that there is a time to win and moment
to lose. That everything is a matter of training, dedication, effort and that, in a
dispute, of course, the best must win.

Defeat should be seen as a stimulus to more training, greater commitment.

With such an attitude, it is not surprising that we have organized fans,
composed of people who were educated in this way, who block a road
and destroy a bus to stone and slap, wishing to assault the players of the
his football team, which was disqualified from the sports tournament.

When children present the bulletin with low grades, the fault is always the
teachers or the school board.

Never of their sprouts that have not studied or perhaps presented low
performance, by some problem they are going through.

It's time to think and take action. First of all, exemplify, as parents,
courtesy, kindness, honesty, respect, in short, all the values that
we wish to have our children.

There is no more time to neglect today's childhood that will be constituted in the
men of tomorrow, the citizens of the new world that we all aspire to.

                                   *   *   *

Let us think: very often, children's rude behavior is
result of a lack of guidance.

It's just that as parents we neglect to establish standards of behavior, and they,
simply act as others observe to act.

Keep in mind that criticism swearing and name-calling only contributes to making
more tense and aggressive children.

Education therefore requires clear standards for children to be established
Follow. Standards dictated by manners, respect for the like,
modesty and justice.
