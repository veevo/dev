Freedom of expression is a recent achievement in the history of mankind.

They don't go far the times where expressing thought could have as a consequence
death sentence.

Despots, tyrants, as well as religions, doctrines, oppressed and curtailed the
free expression of thought.

Today they still insist some to foment their intolerance and
Bans.

However, the achievements of freedom to reflect and
expose the ideas.

When this right is respected by all, we have the possibility to be
between thinking and speaking, giving the other, likewise, such a right.

It is up to each of us to understand that we think differently because we have
values, concepts and worldview very own.

And as far as we respect others, we can gnaw for us that same
Respect.

In those terms, it is up to us to ask: What would be the best religion for anyone?

Certainly, the answer is not unique.

In the diversity of thinking and acting in which humanity plunges, we could elect
a religion like the best?

Certainly, if we were imposed a religion with which we do not agree, that
we didn't accept it, we wouldn't feel comfortable.

This happens to anyone to whom we insist on imposing our
Belief.

The best religion must be one that does not make us hypocrites, which
turns into good, correct people, better human beings.

Therefore, on this subject it is up to each other to choose, no one else.

It will be only in this understanding between the creature and God that one can choose
the best way to get to Him.

Every doctrine or religion that leads man to good must be worthy of
Respect.

This is because when it comes to God's things, the important thing is not the way
that we take, but rather the direction in which we walk.

And there are many understandings and expressions that lead us to the Father.

In such terms, fruitless, when not disrespectful, any imposition of
belief to others.

For some, God is in nature. For others, coexistence is within the
Your temple. And so many cultivate Him in the intimacy of the heart.

Some have him as a loving father. Others may perceive him more as a stern Father.

They are evolutionary stages.

Some adhere fervent to their religious beliefs. Others prefer to live the
his way to his relationship with God.

For the Creator of the Universe, the important thing is not what comes out of the mouth, gestures,
or where it's done.

For the Big Father, the great meaning lies in what goes on in the heart.

In this way, all and all beliefmust be respected, when it leads us and
it's good for us.

    After all, God, above all, understands that we, His children, are still
groping, taking the first steps, in the search to understand His greatness and
                                                                       Kindness.
