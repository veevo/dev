        Work is a law for all planetary humanities.

        From the most rudimentary being to the angelic Spirits who flee by the
destinies of the worlds, each performs his work, his part, in the great concert
universal.

        Painful and coarse for inferior beings, work softens to the
as the Spirit purifies itself.

        It becomes a source of enjoyment for the early Spirit, insensitive to the
material attractions, exclusively occupied with high studies.

        It is by the work that man dominates the blind forces of nature and
preserves from misery.

        It is because of the work that civilizations form, that well-being and
science spread.

        Work is honor, it is the dignity of the human being. The idle ness that
takes advantage of the work of others, without anything producing, is nothing but a parasite.

        When the man is busy with his task, passions are quiet.

        Idleness, on the contrary, instigates them, opening a vast field of
action to manifest themselves.

        The job is also a great comforter, it is a healthy condom
against our afflictions, cons of our sorrows.

        It soothes the anguish of our Spirit and fertilizes our intelligence.

        There is no moral pain, disappointments or setbacks that do not find in it a
Relief.

        There are no vicissitudes that resist their prolonged action.

        Work is always a safe haven in the ordeal, a true friend
in the tribulation.

        From work men approach each other, they learn to
auxiliary, to unite. Hence the fraternity there is only one step.

        When Roman Antiquity dishonored the work, making it a
slavery, resulted in its moral sterility and corruption.

        Work is Divine Law, bound by the Law of Progress. Through it, if
makes the improvement of beings.

        Faced with the needs that man perceives, in the world in which he is
living, puts into action his intelligence and engenders actions, improving his and
the condition of many.

        This is how Technology has advanced and continues to advance, medicine brings,
every day, new and important discoveries to lessen many pains and heal
Diseases.

        This is how surgical techniques are improved, which invent
artifacts, all aiming at the well-being of being, on the Earth on which it is.

        There's a problem. The man thinks and creates something. Something, if not for
solve it, at least to soften it.

        Thinking of his comfort and the desire of the beautiful, every day man creates
bold new architectural forms, embellishing the urban landscape.

        Machines are made available for the dawn of the earth, planting,
harvest with minimal waste.

        All this is work. Work of those who sweat the shirt, in physical exertion.

        Also those who draft laws, in order to preserve life, the
planet, to offer better conditions to humanity.

        Therefore, it works those who use force as much as the one who
triggers your intelligence.

        Uniting, one and the other, progress is achieved faster.

        And everything, thanks to the blessed Labor Law. What would be of our day, without
the blessing of work?

                                     * * *

        Work is life, it's glory, it's the peace of humanity.

        We therefore strive to probe the great problems, in studying the
nature and propagate science, spreading everywhere all that comforts,
soul and fortify.

        That from one end to the other of the world, united in the gigantic work,
each of us strives to contribute to enriching the
material, intellectual and morality of humanity.
