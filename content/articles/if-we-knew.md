If the criminal knew, beforehand, the tribute of pain that life will charge him,
in the adjustment of his destiny, would rather not have arms to give any
Hit.

If the slanderer could eliminate the shadow that drives his vision crazy,
observing the suffering that awaits him in reckoning with the truth,
would paralyze the vocal cords or immobilize the penalty in order not to entrust itself to the
inconvenient prosecution.

If the ungrateful perceived the cat of bitterness that will invade him later the
heart, would not commit the crime of indifference.

If the selfish contemplated the infernal loneliness that awaits him, he would never walk away
of the indefatigable practice of fraternity and cooperation.

If the gluttonous saw the imbalances to which it forwards its own
body, hurling the march to death, would surrender to frugality and
Harmony.

If we knew how terrible the result of our disregard for laws is
we would never walk away from the right path.

                                   *   *   *

Experienced people, when they recall slip-ups from their past, often say:
Oh, if I knew what I know today...

Others say we only learned by even wronging, as if it were the only way, the
that would imply condemning us, like Spirits, to the determinism of error, that is,
we wouldn't have another option.

Obviously the road of mistakes and correct answers educates us and we saw walking through it
for a long time, however, it is not necessary to err to grow towards the
Happiness.

We can learn from the experiences of others and by example.

Reflect: Why, in good conscience, seeing that others are falling into
certain trap on the way, it would also be necessary for us to fall to
Learn?

Isn't it enough to be good observers? Do we also need to fall? It doesn't seem
Nonsense?

Because that's how it is with our evolution. There's always a choice, another route possible.

We all need to get through the creep of ignorance on our evolutionary road.
However, not by the career of evil, of error.

In addition, the Creator has given us the ability to distinguish good from evil, through
our own intelligence. Whenever requested it promptly assists us
in this process of identifying one and the other.

Let us not be alarmed or disturbed by the faults caused by ignorance.
It is transgression that is part of the natural process, of acquiring experience,
maturity, moral wingspan.

The violations of the larger Law we can avoid are those that are already of our
knowledge, either because we experience them or because we are able to
understand that they will not bring good to us or our neighbour.

To make committing the same faults is to suffer for free, is to choose pain without
need, is to delay the arrival of better days.

Many of us will not be able to claim in the future: Oh! If I knew! Because already
we know, we have discernment, we are fully able to choose for good.

Everything is clear.

Truth reaches us from all directions, whether from religions or
philosophies, whether of good men, whether from brief messages that come to us,
like this, apparently without compromise, but that point to us something very serious.

We already know that. Our conscience screams us daily something that bothers us and
asks us to change our lives urgently. The days of the
moral transformation of humanity, of our intimate transformation.
