Human aspiration, physical beauty achieves our aesthetic sense. Fills
the eyes with their colors and shapes. It attracts, awakens desires. Who doesn't want it?

But beauty also brings with it the heavy tribute of envy, greed,
vanity and pride.

Still, we all want her. It is part of human nature to desire
stand out, stand out for something that others don't have.

That's why we extend our desire for physical beauty to partners, children,
clothes, house, garden, objects. We want beauty in everything, all the time. And
we automatically reject what we consider ugly.

But what is physical beauty? A perfect body, a lovely face? Hair
Bright? All this is so fleeting.

The body ages and one day will die.

Taking care of the body is essential, keeping it clean, well taken care of, it's everyone's duty
We. But we don't need to turn the body into the absolute center of our
Attention.

And how do we see that happen, don't we? So many people who remain endless hours in
academies, spending a lot of money on plastic surgeries, liposuction,
medicines to lose weight, creams to slow aging.

A healthy vanity is not reprehensible. Want to be okay, not to confront the others
with a battered appearance is ideal. But there's a limit to exaggeration. And
this limit is sometimes exceeded.

The problem that this all generates is that, at the end of life, what will be from that whose
was full attention in the body?

That's why we see people who get tormented, without accepting their own
age, without being able to be happy. There are so many who suffer because of the musculature
wrinkles and loss of skin viço.

But doesn't suffering for it seem unnecessary?

Yes. We must avoid cultivating suffering under any circumstances,
especially because of a body that is destined to disappear, return to the
Powder.

And yet the beauty of the soul - which will remain forever and ever - rare if
remember to cultivate.

This splendid beauty, which manifests itself in gestures of love, in kind words,
in patience, sweetness and serenity.

Believe me, affectionate attitudes are creams that take away foudade
Spiritual. It's plastic surgeries that restore moral beauty. They are the
our main investment for the future.

But don't think things are simple as a snap of fingers. To
exercising the beauty of the soul is needed more than a simple will. Right
I need discipline. And very important is to have your eyes turned to something beyond
of life on Earth.

If you observe carefully, you will see that most people hold on to
too much to material values. The feeling you have is that the short life on Earth
is the center of all the attention of most of humanity.

Rare are those who fixate their thinking on God and seek to act according to the
laws created by Him.

They see life on Earth only as a passage. That's why they
work, act, relate to people, but have deep awareness of
that everything is fleeting and impermanent.

Living like this has your difficulties. First, because the seduction of the Earth is very
Great. The pleasures, conditions and material sensations have very strong appeals.

They attract us, hold us and keep us tied to the chains of passions and joys
Momentary.

Thus, those who wish to cultivate the beauty of the soul must have discipline because
need to be focused on the immortal values of life to realize the prison that
it is the fraternal life, so as not to allow itself to be imprisoned by the body illusion.

These, with their eyes set on the stars, know that life is much more than the
flesh of the body, which we are part of the immense Divine Plan, where the only beauty
that matters is that of the Spirit who lives for good.

Think about it!
