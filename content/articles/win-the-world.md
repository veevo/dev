What will be more important: win in the world or win the world?

Although the question presents little subtlety between one situation and another, its
meaning is deeply distinct.

Win the world or win the world?

Much of us believe it is extremely important to win in the world, that is,
beat according to current values and standards in the world.

Perhaps that's why we embrace relative moral standards, with the
which, the important thing is to achieve our goals.

Winning in the world is having the brightness, recognition, social and financial success
that he can offer us.

For this, sometimes for our acts there are no limits, usually taxes
morale and ethics. Sometimes we even disrespect
Legal.

So we can become owners of economic empires, become famous,
applauded, icons of this or that, public projection figures.

We can become a reference as businessmen, businessmen,
successful entrepreneurs.

We conquer the world, win in the world, and enjoy the laurels and awards of the
triumphers of the Earth.

Others of us, anonymous and discreet, chose to win the world.

We understand that life is an opportunity to test, develop and strengthen
moral values.

We know that life is fleeting and we strive to live to overcome the
challenges, temptations and difficulties that it presents to us.

From this, we guide our conduct on high moral values, which we elect
as our guide and reference of purposes.

If tuition is offered to us, in the name of a higher gain, we prefer to keep us
levels of unrestricted honesty.

If, in social relations, defamation could benefit us or
privileged social positions, we opted for discretion and respect for others.

In family relationships, in the education of children, we will be able to keep ourselves in the
agenda of duties, without giving ourselves to futile or thoughtless attitudes.

Of course, this second option will require us a price.

Often, we will be misunderstood, misinterpreted, taken into account of
fools and naïve, not knowing how to recognize valuable opportunities of prominence.

We may suffer the detemperof those who cannot understand the posture
that we assume, nor the values that lead us to the days.

It is important that, resolute, we remain without allowing us to win by the seductions
fools of the transient world.

It is Jesus who invites us to endure to the end.

Have good cheer, I beat the world, encourages us the Good Shepherd.

And it offers us the roadmap of conduct to win the world.

Just follow him in the booklet of love for others that was his whole existence.

Thus, let us maintain good cheer, when the difficulties arise, fruits of
our good conduct and correct act.

Let us keep the Gospel of the Master safe, and remain
firm, I don't challenge proceeding.
