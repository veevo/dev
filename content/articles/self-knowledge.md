Allan Kardec, the Codifier of Spiritism, asked the Spirits:

What is the most effective practical means man has to improve himself in this life and to resist the attraction of evil?

The Benefactors of Humanity responded:

A wise man of antiquity he said, Know yourself.

The Spiritist Doctrine shows us the path we must go to achieve this intention: self-knowledge.

The walk, therefore, is in the opposite direction to what we have sought so far. It's inside ourselves, not abroad.

Some of us do not know each other, we have no idea who we are, of what our behavior will be in the face of a certain situation. Anyway, we are an illustrious unknown to ourselves.

By the ignorance of our feelings, sometimes we take misguided attitudes, which cause us displeasure as soon as we realize what happened.

A lady always claimed that if she was ever assaulted, she would be immobilized, petrified; that certainly would not have the strength to react.

Your friend, for her part, said she would react, that if i had to fight, but she wouldn't let it cheap no.

One day, they were both talking on the sidewalk. A boy came by and took the bag from the one who said he'd react. She was paralyzed.

The other, who had claimed to be immobilized, ran after the boy, giving him his purse on her back and screaming to return her friend's purse.

The boy, who did not expect such a reaction, threw his bag on the ground and left, because he thought it best to save his own life.

This proves that both were unaware of their tendencies, because in the face of the unexpected they had reactions contrary to those who claimed they would have.

Many of us also don't know each other, we don't usually do a thorough analysis of our intimacy.

Thus, we are easily surprised by ourselves in the face of unusual situations.

To know how much pride and selfishness, the worst wounds of society, we still carry in us, we just notice ourselves sincerely, in the small acts of everyday life, that we will perceive clearly.

Observing our reaction to a friend's indifference, the little case they make of a job we perform, the hairstyle or the clothes we wear, or when someone draws our attention.

Each person is a Universe that needs to be discovered, so that he can shine the light that lays in his depths.

We are all lucigenites, children of light, for the Creator, who is the Supreme Light, thus made us all.

If we carefully examine our intimacy, we will realize that we already have many achievements, but that we still need to take a few steps to really shine our light. It's just a matter of time and willingness.

St. Augustine, one of the Fathers of the Church, collaborated in the Codification of the Spiritist Doctrine.

The answer we referred to at the beginning was given by him. He recommends that each of us do as he did when he lived on Earth.

Each night he was an analysis of how his day had been.

And always sought to correct what needed to be corrected, seeking to be every day better than the day before.
