A common question that people who believe in the existance of [spirits](/about/spirit)
ask is: "can spirits influence us?"

[Allan Kardec](/bio/allan-kardec) asked that question on [The Spirits' Book](/books/spirits-book), 
Q. 459:

> Do spirits influence our thoughts and actions?  
> "To a greater extent than you suppose, they can have a significant influence on both."  <br><br>
> [The Spirits book, Question 459](/books/allan-kardec/spirits-book/459)


Still According to [Allan Kardec](/bio/allan-kardec):
> "inspiration comes to us all, from spirits who influence us, for good or for evil, in every circumstance of our lives, and in every resolution we make, and it may therefore be truly said that, in this respect, everyone is a medium, for there is no one who has not about him his familiar spirits, who do their utmost to suggest salutary or pernicious counsels to those with whom they are connected."
