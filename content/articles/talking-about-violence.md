Speaking of violence...

Violence is the act of embarrassing physically or morally. It's the use of force.

Today, many are the ones who claim to fear violence. That's why,
we erected high walls around our residences, trying to prevent her from
reach us.

We hire security guards to protect our businesses and our homes. Installed
sophisticated equipment that alerts us to the arrival of possible usurpers
of our goods.

We fear the robbery, the theft, the physical embarrassment, the aggression. We're back
violence that comes from outside and can reach us.

However, there is another type of violence that we do not pay attention to. It is the one that
resides in us.

It's the violence of indifference. The one that allows us to observe daily,
by the news, the landscapes of hunger, misery and continuing with our arms
Cross.

Yes, some of us are sensitized, reaching tears, but the headlines
the following divert our attention and everything falls by oblivion, which notes
erased and worthless.

Violence that allows us to assist, extremely interested, the news
about the aggression suffered by important personality, eager for details
and more details.

We want to know everything and the greater the violence towards the creature, the more
because after all, later, soon, we will reprise everything for the
colleague, the neighbor, the friend.

And we do not remember to gather the intimacy of the heart to pray for the
assaulted by his own. Apart from fame, they're people like everyone else. Suffer as
all, provided that pain has a universal and impartial character.

We actively participate in or assist impassively to programmes where the
human is exposed in all its moral nudity.

Where physical or intimate problems are brought public as short stories
for fun and leisure. However, those involved are human beings who feel,
suffer, distress.

Violence from within, which we feed every day, allowing it to become
voracious hydra.

Violence is the attitude with which we target old and difficult sick to
institutions, without ever taking an interest in their well-being.

We often relieve awareness by saying that we do not have time for
care, because we work too hard. We pay for them to meet them,
distance, so as not to hear them the Queixumes and lamentations.

And they could be with us! If we can afford the currency resources for
keep away, why not direct these same resources to those who can
caring, caring, caring, close to us, in our watchful eyes?

Violence is the act of muteness that we elect to assault each other in the relationship
establishing icy silences to affectionate interrogations.

It is the son who closes himself, not answering the questions of love
as a form of aggression for not granting him what he craves.

It is the spouses who, among themselves, hire muteness as a symbol of the discomfort of
live next to each other, as chained without remission.

Violence is the indifference to the well-being of others, which allows us to reach home,
be served at all and even raise your eyes to see the wrinkles of
worry, tears of pain on the macerated face of those who serve us.

It is to get up, eat, enjoy the goods, lie down, without contributing to anything
for the peace of the home.

And it would be enough to smile, thank you, who knows, to embrace those who suffer the lack of
our tenderness.

The violence from the outside can hurt us and hurt us. Violence from within, silent,
that we apply every day, in our relationships is equally pernicious
and destructive.

Many diseases nest and evolve gradually or abruptly, as
result of the intimate violence itself or that of others, usually well-affected by the
Next.

Mute, indifference, coldness. Violence that is reprised, cruel weapons.

We begin to enlist violence from us, exercising dialogue, forgiveness,
good feelings.

And we will see, just as in the soil believed by the invernia, burst ing into flowers and
the spring of peace, in our hearts.
