It is overly commented on the need for leisure as a measure of
rest and renewal of forces.

Leisure, yes; idleness, no.

Man is biologically prepared and programmed for action and not for the
Home.

Dynamism vitalizes it, develops it, while immobility weakens it,
atrophy it.

Leisure does not mean lack of activity, but physical, emotional and
intellectual attitude, work.

Action motivates life; the home discourages it.

Leisure is necessary to facilitate the relaxation of tensions, in order to
enable reflection, the programming of new activities.

But it is not effective only when it takes place in balnearia stations,
sports, beaches, mountains, well-covered trips.

These leisure mechanisms comply with market requirements that sell emotions
producing other states of anguish, anxiety, tiredness.

The home and the family, the refuge in a lonely place, music, silence and  
provide intimate leisure states with excellent results for the
personal renewal.

There are organizations specialized in leisure, which dehumanize the individual, who
to be manipulated by experts who impose so on it what seems best to them and not
what, in fact, every man wants and needs.

Relying on leisure to avoid the neurosis of work, those who stop acting
almost always become victims of neurosis of lack of what to do.

And that's why many take vacations and travel, take refuge in nooks
do sports of the most varied, and come back more tired and
unhappy than before.

Why does this happen?

It is precisely because rest means the change of activity. But of nothing
is worth changing activity and taking in mind the various concerns and neuroses of the
day-to-day.

The human being is not like an electronic device, which just triggera button to
Hang up. If that were the case, it would be easy and practical.

The human mind is this mechanism that takes in itself the elements of calm and
tranquility or reasons for worries and anxieties, wherever you go.

For this reason, the change of environment or city alone does not solve the
stress problem, nor does it offer the necessary rest.

It is necessary to offer leisure and rest also to the mind. In addition to changing activities
routine, it is necessary to have a certain quiet awareness.

It is to fulfill your daily obligations; have organization and discipline in the
not overloading colleagues with duties that are theirown.

It is to be well with the affections, with the responsibilities assumed, with the accounts in
Day.

Unless so, you can escape the city, the country, the planet, but when
support the head for the much desired rest, you will realize that you took with you the
reasons for their stress and anxiety.

Seek a moment of leisure, yes. But, running away from yourself is an attempt that does not
Works.

                                   *   *  *

Work, far from being cause for tiredness and stress, is valuable treasure that
it provides us with dignity, giving useful ness to the hours.

In these moments of more leisure and idleness that I work, deserves consideration the
teaching of Jesus: The Father to this day works and I also work.

With this, we can conclude that work is not a punishment nor should it be
regarded as an undesirable obligation, but as an indispensable factor for the
progress and the evolution of being.
