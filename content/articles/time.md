An unknown author once wrote that joy, sadness, vanity,
wisdom, love, and other feelings inhabited a small island. One day,
were warned that this island would be flooded.

Concerned, love took care that all others would be saved, saying:

Escape everyone, the island will be flooded.

Everyone rushed to pick up their little boat to take shelter on a very high hill,
on the continent. Only love was in no hurry. When he realized he was going to drown,
ran to ask for help.

For the terrified wealth, he asked: Wealth, take me with you.

To which she replied: I can't, my boat is full of gold and silver and has no
place for you.

Then he passed the vanity and he said, Dona Vanity, take me with you...

I'm sorry, but you're going to get my boat dirty.

Then came the sorrow and love begged: Lady Sorrow, I can go with
You?

Honey, I'm so sad, I'd rather go alone.

He passed the joy, but he was so cheerful that he didn't even hear love call for
She.

Then he passed a little boat, where he was sore an elderly gentleman, and he said:

Come up, baby, I'll take you.

Love was so happy, he even forgot to ask the old man's name.

Arriving at the high hill, where were already the other feelings, he asked the
Wisdom:

Ms. Wisdom, who was the gentleman who supported me?

She said, Time.

The weather? But why did he bring me here?

Because only time is able to help and understand a great love.

Among all the gifts that divinity grants man, time takes place
Special. It is he who calms undue passions, teaching that everything has its
the right time and place.

It is he who heals the wounds from deep pain, putting cotton
anesthesia in open wounds.

It is the time that allows us to mature, through the sound exercise of reflection,
acquiring weighting and common sense.

It's the time you draw marks on your faces, spreads snow in your hair, teaches calm
patience, when the step is already slower.

It is the time that confirms the great truths and destroys falsehoods, values
Illusory.

Time is, at last, a great master, who teaches without haste, awaits somewhat
more and expects each in turn to be willing to grow, serve and be happy.

And it is time, in fact, that shows us, in the course of years, that the
true love overcomes age, sickness, difficulty, and stays with us
forever.

*   *   *

In this world, everything has its time. Every thing has its time.

There's time to be born and the time to die. Time to plant and spoon. Time
to overthrow and build.

There's time to become sad and rejoice. Time to cry and smile.
Time to spread stones and gather them.

Time to hug and move away.

There's time to shut up and talk. There's wartime and peacetime. But always
it's time to love.
