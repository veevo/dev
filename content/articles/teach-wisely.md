        Have you ever had any difficulty convincing your son to do some
thing he didn't want or felt unable to do?

        If so, what was the tactic used for this conviction?

        The answers are as varied as possible, but generally not
we use efficient strategies because our patience does not allow it.

        However, in order for us to achieve a satisfactory result in the education of
children, you have to teach wisely.

        A little story of two brothers will show us that.

        The boy, standing in front of the high mountain, told his older sister:

        "I can't climb this hill. It's impossible! What's going to happen
Me? Am I going to spend my whole life here at the foot of the hill? That's too terrible!"

        "What a pity!" Said sister. "But look, little brother, I discovered a joke
great!"

        At the same moment, he stepped the ground and challenged his brother: I doubt
that you can leave a footprint as sharp on earth as mine."

        The boy accepted the challenge and took a step forward. He put his foot in the
ground and replied with joy:

        "Look! My footprint is just like yours!"

        "Do you think?" He asked his sister. "Look at mine again. Now I'm going to
step deeper, because I'm heavier than you.

        Try again, and see if you can step on stronger," continued the
Sister.

        "Now mine is as deep as yours!" cried the boy with
Joy.

        And with satisfaction continued to take steps and make footprints more and more
Strong.

        "Look, sis! This, this and this, are as deep as possible."

        "yes, it's really good, " said the sister. "But now it's my turn, let
I try again and let's see."

        And they continued, step by step, comparing the footprints and laughing at the
cloud of dust they left behind.

        It didn't take long and the boy looked up.

        "Hey, " he said, "we're high on the hill."

        "Wow!" Said sister. "We are."

        The girl, using wisdom, managed to convince her brother that he did not
was willing to face the hill walk up.

        His tactic was to walk in front of him and challenge him to do the same,
in the form of a joke.

        But, contrary to your attitude, many of us use the most
difficult, that's the push. We want children to overcome difficulties and
limitations on the basis of blackmail or traditional "sopapo".

        Perhaps that's why our attempts often don't
give good results.

        For this reason, it is worth thinking about how best to drive our
education so that they can get to the point we desire, without scars
and no trauma.

        Let's think about it!
