Maybe today... we have awakened in the morning with an oppressed heart, with a
strange feeling and the gray day more have reinforced our discouraged feeling.

Let us remember, however, that it's just another morning. Everything out there is under the
gray clouds, maintains the same colors as yesterday.

And we don't have to make ourselves always radiant and sunny inside.

We can accept rainy and sunny days as part of the seasons without
great emotional shocks.

Maybe today... we've waited for something from someone and that person hasn't had us
Corresponded.

Let us think that there may be another being thinking the same about us. Like this
offer new chances, knowing that people are different, that they do not feel
like us, who don't think with our thoughts.

Maybe today... our body has given us some sign of imbalance through
pain or discomfort.

Before any immediate attitude of searching for medication that takes away suffering
or resolve the issue quickly, let us reflect on the causes of instability
physical, for they will always be in the soul.

It will be no use resolving the effect if the cause persists. Let's pick up one and the other.

Maybe today... someone will test us patience, understanding or
Indulgence. Let's not put ourselves in a victim position.

Let us imagine ourselves as the student at school, who should always be prepared for the
surprise evidence, those teachers never warn will do.

Maybe today... some friend heart appears imposing us pictures of pessimism and
disturbance, in relation to the difficulties of the world.

Although we compress us from the creature that gives itself to defeatism and discouragement,
we can be one who points to renewal for good that Divine Wisdom
promotes everywhere.

Maybe today... less pleasant news may cause us unrest and
we're in trouble. However, we retain our own peace and not
let us disconnect from our prayers and thoughts of optimism and hope.

Maybe today... everything seems against us. But let's continue to understand and act,
in support of good, keeping the certainty that God is with us and that tomorrow
it's going to be another day.

                                   *   *   *

This is the world of afflictions. Hospital-school, planet Earth provides everyone
its inhabitants the opportunity for treatment, healing and education.

We coldly question our consciences all who are hurt in the
heart by the vicissitudes and disappointments of life.

Let us return, step by step, to the origin of the evils that torture us and verify
if, more often, we cannot say: if I had done, or left of
do such a thing, would not be in such a condition.

To whom, then, we have to hold accountable for all these afflictions, if not to us
Same?

It is therefore, in a large number of cases, the cause of our own
Misfortunes.

But instead of recognizing this, we find it simpler, less humiliating to
our vanity accuses luck, Providence, bad fortune, bad star, 
when the bad star is just our slouch.
