Some claim that teacher is a task that is in decline, considering the
low class wages.

Others point out that dedicated, attentive teachers, those who embrace the
profession by legitimate vocation, are endangered. Always feasible to reproduce
some facts, which tell us that there is a lot of love circulating through schools.

A young man met his former teacher and asked him: Hi, teacher, remembers
of me?

Like many of us, who did not archive photographic records in memory,
answered the professional not remember him at all.

But he asked him, "What are you doing?

The answer was quick: I'm a teacher. I embraced the magisterium because of you.

The teacher's surprise was great. Not only did he not remember that student
as not remotely, could i imagine what he had done that might have stimulated
the young man like that.

And the boy said: One day, a friend of mine, student of the same class, appeared with
a new, beautiful watch.

He was an expensive model, and right away, I wished it for myself.

In a moment of distraction from his colleague, I caught him and put it in my pocket.

When he noticed the theft, he complained to you.

Loud and clear, you gave the order for the watch to be returned to your
Owner. No one moved. They looked at each other, as I myself did, to
Disguise.

So you went to the door and locked her. He asked us all to stand up and
we closed our eyes.

Slowly, it went from one to another student, searching his pockets. Found the clock
in mine, but continued to go through magazine until the last of the class.

When it was over, he declared that the clock had been found. We all open the
Eyes.

There was no charges, no warning. Never mentioned the
episode, did not declare to the curious class who had committed the theft.

That day, you saved my dignity. It was the most shameful day of
my life.

I was hoping that at some point, I'd call myself in private, to
talk about honesty, morals. Nothing.

So I understood what a real educator was. And I wished, ardently,
be like this.

Help, perhaps, at some point, an undisciplined boy, lost in himself
Same.

Finally, the young man concluded: I think it's strange that you don't remember that. No
did you mark my physiognomy?

And the serene teacher replied, Sorry. I remember the stolen watch, from me
have searched the whole class.

But, really, I don't remember you because of one detail: when I went to make the
magazine, I was groping in the dark because I also closed my eyes.

                                   *   *   *

What a lesson! How many of us need to follow this example. Because we have a lot
hurry and almost pleasure in pointing out the faults of those of the other.

However, Christian action tells us that the absences of others should only be
disclosed when they object ed to the good of people.

As such an example impresses and positively marks a life.

As we need this behavior these days. Of this care about the
image of the other, who, at a time of unvigilance, made a mistake, a failure.

And it needs our compassion, above all, a second chance.

Let's think about it.
