When someone seeks an excuse to justify their weaknesses, it is common
let us hear the statement that meat is weak.

The fault, therefore, is the flesh, that is, of the physical body.

This is a subject that deserves deeper reflections.

Hahnemann, creator of homeopathic medicine, made the following statement:

The body does not give anger to the one who does not have it, just as it does not give others
Vices. All virtues and all vices are inherent in the spirit. A no
be like this, where would merit and responsibility be?

Wise consideration of this, for it contains great truths.

Blaming the body for our weaknesses would amount to blaming the clothes we're in.
using by cholera access.

When the mouth of a gluttonous fills with saliva before an appetizing dish, it does not
it is the food that excites the organ of the palate, because it is not even in contact with it.

It is the Spirit, whose sensitivity is awakened, that acts on that organ
through thought.

If a sensitive person easily sheds tears, it is not the abundance of
tears that gives sensitivity to the Spirit, but precisely the sensitivity
of this which causes abundant secretion of tears.

So a man is a musician not because his body is prone to musicality, but
because his Spirit is a musician.

As we can see, the Spirit's action on the physical body is so evident
that a violent moral commotion can cause organic disorders.

When we suffer a fright, for example, soon after comes to sweating, the
tremor, diarrhea.

Other times, an access of anger can cause headache, tachycardia, and even
even leave purple spots on the body.

As regards the provisions for laziness, sensuality, violence,
corruption, also cannot be thrown into the meat account, as they are
tendencies rooted in the immortal Spirit.

If it wasn't, it would be easy, because we wouldn't have any responsibility
by our acts, since once buried the body, with it would all disappear
weaknesses and misconceptions committed.

All moral responsibility of the acts of physical life compete with the Spirit
Immortal. It couldn't even be any different.

Thus, the more enlightened the Spirit, the less excusable become the
their faults, since, with intelligence and moral sense, the notions are born
good and evil, just and the unjust.

                                   *   *   *

All of us, without exception, possess in intimacy the divine spark, the strength
able to contain the negative impulses and make the noble emotions vibrate that the
Creator has deposited in us.

Making small efforts we will conquer true freedom, supremacy
of the Spirit upon the body. And only then will we understand why Jesus said: You
you are gods, you will be able to do what I do, and more.
