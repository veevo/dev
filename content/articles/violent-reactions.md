It is becoming common for people to react with violence to the evil they
happens, or to what is at odds with your wishes.

Just like the unruly child reacts, screaming, throwing things when
their wills are not met, people are allowing themselves to assault,
Retaliate.

When traffic is slow there are those who curse public administration who do not
plans better routes for rapid disposal of vehicles.

If the store reports that the item on offer is over, there are those who are entitled
to assault employees, accusing them of misleading propaganda.

If the box is wrong in return, it is soon stated that he is a dishonest individual,
desiring to fatten his own salary.

If the maid asks to leave a little earlier, saying she should take the
son to the doctor, soon someone says that she does not wish to work, that is
making up lies.

If someone bumps into someone else on the street, they immediately shout some that the
subject is rude, rude. An abuse!

In short, we are living a time of great aggression. And we complained
of the violence that takes over the streets, without paying attention that ourselves, many
times, we also act with violence.

Perhaps for this time, a great military man, desiring himself spiritualize, chose a
religious sage and asked him:

Where does hell start?

The experienced thinker meditated and said: Why an unscrupulous man desires
know where hell begins? Full of life-destroying weapons, it comes to
me to silly questions. What do you expect me to tell you, I, that I am a man of
peace and justice?

Before he continued, the military interrupted him, lifting his sword and demanding,
full of anger, may the wise respect him.

Without any fear, the old man clarified:

Here begins hell: in uncontrolled anger.

The officer understood and, in a quick gesture, again put the sword on the hem,
Apologizing.

The wise then enlightened him: Man, in this gesture his begins heaven.

                                   *   *   *

Anger can be compared to a power-carrying spark of large triggering
Fires. Just a bad ly thought out word, an unforeseen gesture to generate it.

When released, it triggers useless and destructive conflicts.

The man who feeds anger and lets himself dominate for it, becomes crude and
Violent.

The antidotes to anger are humility that leads the individual to recognize the
fragility itself; patience, which allows it to monitor the development of
of the question; tolerance that understands the difficulty of those of those of the world; at last, the love that is
blessed light in all circumstances.
