A simple sticker, fixed in a car glass, reveals a philosophy of life
very dangerous.

It says like this: Life is short. Break some rules.

We need to analyze this culture of Enjoy life, because it is short, with
pretty careful.

We realize that this kind of understanding circulates around the world by doing many
fans who sometimes fall into terrible traps without realizing it.

There seems to be in many people an aversion to rules, to laws, even when these
serve only to regulate life in society. So much needed.

It is the revulsion to responsibility that still finds strength in so many minds that
insist on not growing.

Breaking rules simply for fun or thinking life is too much
- as we speak – is childish, immature and dangerous attitude.

All it takes is, for example, once, to extrapolate at speed when driving a
to commit a lifetime.

A joke, a simple catch, through the roads of a city, to put itself in
a large number of lives, including their own.

So it's not a kind of rule that can be broken from time to time.

Why break rules to enjoy life? Who said to make out
every moment of existence with joy, do we need to break laws?

Enjoying life doesn't mean doing what you want, when and wherever you want.
This is the materialistic, poor and immediate view of existing.

Enjoying life is to do what should be done, determined by the
consciousness of the spiritual being, who knows that he is in the world for a very reason
Special.

The mature, conscious being finds in the way of good, family, love, his
enjoy, without having to go around breaking rules and breaking laws.

Life is short or long. The choice is in the living.

She's short for those who waste time on idleness. Long for those who
dedicate themselves to a noble cause.

Life is short for those who accompany their children to grow from afar. Long for
those who enjoy every instant, every good morning kiss, every good kiss
Night.

Life is short for those who think addictions don't hurt. Long for those who
develop healthy habits for their days.

Life is short for those who think life is one. Long for those who have already
discovered that the Spirit is immortal, existed before this life and will continue to
existing later.

Life is short for those who don't forgive. The hurt kills earlier. It is long for
who seek reconciliation, avoiding destructive revenge.

Life is short for those who don't smile. Depression kills early. It's long for
who cultivates good humor in the face of the difficult situations of existence.

Life is short for villains. Long for heroes.

Life can be short or long. It's up to you to choose.
