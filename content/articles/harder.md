The Third Millennium, which has come to us with so many colors of joy, advances. The
months have turned into years and what the world offers us, in general, is
still a frame of almost desolation.

Reports show us revenges that result in deaths or assaults
Violent.

Many films introduce us to the presumed good man, who transforms, of
one moment for the other, in a killer stalker of the aggressors of his
Loves.

We wonder where we walk, we, this humanity that awaits the
world of peace.

We easily adopt evil retribution for evil.

The lesson taught by the Master of Nazareth remains forgotten.

However, men of value bear undisputed testimony that we have the ability to
to forgive. And that forgiveness benefits those who give it and who receives it.

We remember the Olympic athlete and captain of the American Air Force, who fought in the
World War II.

Louis Zamperini, in May 1943, was summoned for a mission to search for a
missing plane. His own plane suffered a problem in both engines and crashed
at sea.

Of the ten-man team, only three survived and drifted in two
life-saving boats.

Finally, only Louis and Russen Allen Phil remained.

It was forty-seven days at sea to finally be rescued by the
japanese and taken to The Island of Execution.

He underwent medical experiments, tortures and shown as if it were a
rare animal in a cage. Hunger was a constant.

He was later transferred to the Omori prisoner of war camp, where
he met his most terrible torturer, known as The Bird.

This commander felt pleasure in torture. I had the ability to hit a
prisoner for hours. And Louis seemed to be his obsession for the
Beatings.

He even lost his left ear hearing temporarily because he was
violently assaulted, with a belt.

At the end of the war, Louis was in the prison camp considered the most
japan's infernal, the Naoetsu, still under the command of the same Japanese sergeant.

Louis returned home, plagued by hatred and a desire for revenge. It became
alcoholic and almost ended his marriage.

However, while at sea, he had orara and promised that he would survive,
would dedicate his life to God.

It took a while to make it happen. So your wife convinced him to go to a cult
evangelical and he began his transformation.

He became a preacher and his recurring theme was forgiveness.

He confessed that when he replaced hatred for love, forgiving his enemies and
praying for them, it ceased to be haunted by nightmares.

Visited many fellow prisoner camp to tell them that they should
forgive their evildoers.

And let's not think it was easy for him to decide. He claimed that the hardest was
Forgive. But hatred is self-destructive. Who hates it doesn't hurt the other but you
Same. Forgiveness, he said, is a cure, a self-healing.

                                   *   *   *

If we are suffering the hardships of hatred, let us think about it and propose ourselves
Free. Let us try forgiveness and let ourselves go.

After all, we all deserve to be happy.
