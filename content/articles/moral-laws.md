The law of universal gravitation is one of the laws governing the physical
world. That no one can contest.

Just as there are laws governing the physical universe, there are laws governing
the moral world.

Jesus referred to them when he assailed:

It's easier to pass the sky and earth than to lose a tilde of the Law.

We know that Jesus could not refer to human laws, so flaws yet.

Many crimes are committed in the most complete anonymity. How could human laws
punish such infractions if they do not become aware of them?

Jesus knew in full the mechanisms governing moral laws. He knew that no
infraction goes unnoticed. I knew that we are all immersed in them and that we
can never circumvent them without assuming the consequences.

That way, no tilde of the law will be lost. All our thoughts and misguided acts
are recorded in the sublime archives waiting for proper repair.

Just as all thoughts and acts in accordance with these Laws are credited in our
moral economy, constituting luminous merits in our favor.

When Jesus stated that each one will be given according to his works, he
splendidly summarized the mechanism of Divine Justice.

There is nothing more comforting than knowing that each will respond sooner or
later for the acts committed.

So we don't have to take care of ourselves or wear on other people's
misconceptions. Human laws take care of them. And what may escape the laws of
men will not escape the Divine Laws.

When Peter the Apostle questioned the Master about the fate of the corrupt and
unjust men of his time, Jesus wisely answered, "Don't worry about them, Peter.
They'll live.

The Master's response was short but deeply wise. Jesus knew that life does not
cease. I also knew that soon again offenders would have to remake the
misconceptions and adjust with the Laws, of which one does not lose even a
tilde.

So when levity and corruption, violence and indifference of men bother us, we
have one certainty: they will live.

Let us not despair, for each will receive according to his works.

There are ten moral laws that govern life.

They are: Law of worship, Labor law, Breeding Law, Conservation Law, Law of
Destruction, Law of Society, Law of Progress, Equality Law, Law of Freedom and
Law of Justice, Love and Charity.

This classification of laws was brought by the Superior Spirits.

This subject and so many others who concern us are developed in Allan Kardec's
The Book of Spirits.

It is an easy-to-read book, because it is willing in the form of questions and
answers, all bound didactically.
