Modernity is rich in means for people to exterhrate their thoughts.

Through the resources of the Internet, many daily share with the world the
his way of seeing life.

In blogs, social networks, virtual columns and videos, it became democratized and
personal exposure has been expanded.

In this environment, criticism stems from other people's behavior.

Also usual are the effect phrases put to circulate.

Thoughts of great figures are remembered and beaded.

All this has great renewing potential.

But in order to be even positive, it is appropriate to reflect on a passage of the
Gospel.

In it, Jesus invites his disciples to go together to the neighboring villages, to
that He preached there too.

And he claims it was for the preaching activity that came into the world.

It is interesting to think about the meaning of the concept of preaching.

He has been misrepresented frequently, to justify much speech
Inconsequential.

For sure, Jesus included in the act of preaching all the sacrificial gestures of his
Life.

Not only did he talk, but he also exemplified.

We generally see on Earth the mission of teaching very demoralized.

Official science has chairs.

Politics has tribunes.

Religion speaks of pulpits.

However, those who teach, with commendable exceptions, are almost always characterized by
by two different ways of acting.

They exhibit certain attitudes when they preach, but adopt others when in activity
Daily.

This results in a serious general disturbance.

After all, listeners also feel comfortable changing character clothes.

In a similar situation are many of those who cry against evil through
of the internet.

They complain about other people's dishonesty.

They point out that someone should take action or take steps to save the
Similar.

But they rarely have to do something effective in order for the world to become
Better.

Also sometimes those who complain about the government or politicians follow without complying with the
their duties.

It's not good to educate your children.

It does not pay due attention to your spouse, does not take care of your old parents or
Sick.

Or he denies tributes, seeks to take advantage when the opportunity appears.

It is a serious incoherence to point out the error in the behavior of others and not
fulfill their own duties with righteousness.

Every dissertation shaped in good is useful.

Jesus came into the world for that.

He preached the truth everywhere, made renewal speeches, commented on the
need of love for the solution of problems.

However, he mixed words and testimonies alive, from the first word of
Your apostolate to the cross.

By preaching, therefore, Jesus also understood the sacrifices of life.

Your stripping on Calvary is living proof of that.

Think about it.
