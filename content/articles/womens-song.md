"Let the other know when I'm afraid, and take me in my arms without doing
too many questions.

Let the other note when I need silence and don't leave knocking the door,
But understand that I won't love you less because I'm quiet.

May the other accept that I care about him and not get mad at my
concern, and if it is excessive know how to tell me this with delicacy or good
humor.

Let the other perceive my frailty and not laugh at me, nor take advantage of it.

That if I'm just tired the other doesn't think i'm nervous right away, or
patient, or aggressive, don't even say I complain too much.

May the other feel how much the idea of loss hurts, and dare stay with me a little
- instead of coming back to your life soon.

That if I'm at a bad time the other is my accomplice, but without making a fuss or
saying 'Look, I'm having a lot of patience with you!'

That when I unintentionally say something very inappropriate in front of more people,
the other one doesn't expose me or ridicule me.

That if I eventually lose patience, Lose grace and lose my composure, the
another still think So think I'm beautiful and admire me.

May the other not always consider me available, always necessarily
understanding, but accept me when I'm not able to be any of that.

That, finally, the other understands that even if I sometimes struggle, I am not, nor
I must be, wonder woman.

But only one person: vulnerable and strong, incapable and glorious, frightened and
audacious -- a woman."

Understanding the other is an art.

Requires effort, concentration, detachment, disposition.

Some might think, "But how can I get into each other's minds, penetrate your
feelings, and find out what's going on there?"

There's the reason for the analogy with art.

It requires empathy – putting ourselves in the place of the other.

The word empathy is derived from the Greek "empatheia", which means affection or
passion, or even "get into feeling".

The Greeks understood that to properly observe a work of art was
necessary to "get into your feeling", observe it from the inside out.

The fourth edition of Webster's new World College Dictionary sets empathy
as: "the projection of his own personality in the personality of another
person in order to understand it better.

It is also found as the ability to share emotions, thoughts
or feelings with others."

Some therapists embrace a broader definition. They say we're empathic
when we respond to the patient's need when we offer him what he
needs to improve.

Without empathy we isolate ourselves in our own feelings, without exchange, without
Power.

Without empathy our energy exchanges encounter barriers, imaginary lines
where feeling can't go through.

Without a doubt, empathy is a new stage in human relationships,
fundamental to grow and understand ourselves at deeper levels.

                                     * * *

Christ's proposal to do to others what we want others to
do, is the most beautiful and complete lesson in empathy to date existing.
