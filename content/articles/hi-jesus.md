Every day, at noon, a poor old man entered the church and, a few minutes
then i'd leave. One day, the sexton asked him what he was doing, for there were objects
of value in the church.

I come to pray, answered the old man.

But it's weird, said the sexton, that you can pray so quickly.

Well, you retorted the old man, I can't pray those long prayers. But all
day, at noon, I enter the church and say:

"Hi Jesus, I am The Ze. I came to visit you."

One minute, I'm just leaving. It's just a little prayer, but I'm sure He
Listen to me.

A few days later, Zé suffered an accident and was admitted to a hospital. In
infirmary, began to exert great influence on everyone.

The saddest patients became cheerful and in that environment where before only
if they heard laments, now many laughs have come to be heard.

One day, the nun responsible for the infirmary approached Zé and commented: The
other patients say you're always so cheerful, Yogi...

The poor sick replied promptly: It is true, sister. I'm always very
Cheerful! And I'm telling you it's because of that visit I get every day. She
makes me immensely happy.

Her sister was intrigued. I had noticed that the chair leaning against Zé's bed
it was always empty. That old man was a loner with no one.

Who visits you? And at what time? He asked him.

Well, sister, every day, at noon, he comes to stand by the bed for some
minutes, maybe seconds... When I look at Him, He smiles and says to me:

"Hi Yogi, I am Jesus, I came to visit you."

                                   *   *  *

The story is simple and its author is unknown.

However, the teaching it contains makes us reflect deeply.

It tells us about faith, simplicity, dedication and perseverance.

Who of us has, like Zé, daily, a few minutes to talk to
Jesus?

Many still confuse prayer with a heaking of words that come out
of the mouth, devoid of feeling and humility.

How many of us have such perseverance, both in the hours of joy and in the
pain, to raise thought to Jesus, entrusting him with our intimacy, with the
sure that He will hear us?

Prayer is a bridge that is detained from the oppressive soul so that relief can
Get.

 It is the mysterious thread, which puts us in communion with the divine spheres.

It is a balm that heals our inner wounds.

It is a temple, in whose sweet intimacy we will find peace and refuge.

Finally, to the shadows of our soul, prayer will always be liberating
dawn, filled with renewal and light.

It is important that we have cultivated unwavering faith in sovereign laws governing life
and of which sublime Galileo brought us news.

We must pray, even if our prayer is simple, but that it is moved by the
Feeling.

                                   *   *   *

Praying, you will come to the Lord, who gave you, in prayer, a safe means of communication
with the infinite goodness of God, in whose unsedentary boon the afflicted Spirit...
