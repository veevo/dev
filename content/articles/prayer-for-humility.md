Humility is one of the most difficult virtues to be conquered.

Humility means virtue characterized by the consciousness of the very
Limitations. Modesty, simplicity.

To achieve it we need to undress from the exacerbated pride accepting that no
we are foolproof, that we are not always right.

Accept that we find ourselves on our way, like the others, that long will still be the
journey that is up to us to undertake.

Fundamental, in this process of conquest of humility, the self-knowledge that
will allow us to become aware of how we are, both in limitations and in
qualities achieved.

Yes, because being humble is to fully accept one's own defects and qualities,
without the need to invoke vanity.

Humility is essential to healthy relationships.

When we are humble, we respect others and, because we recognize ourselves
equally imperfect, we express compassion for those who make mistakes.

                                   *   *   *

In our evolutionary process, change entrenched habits, cultivate virtues, more
what a need, it is a great challenge to us.

We need to become aware of this need and use the resources
possible to achieve the goal.

The virtues, once conquered, become part of our wealth
Spiritual.

There is no market that sells them, nor who can give them to us. What I need is
that we have met for the need for their cultivation in our own intimacy, provided that
that we all bring them into germ.

Reasoned faith can be assisting us in this goal.

For the conquest of humility, this beautiful and delicate flower that must bloom in the
garden of our hearts, we mainly need to raise awareness of the
our smallness and our difficulties.

Nothing better than willingness to sincerely prayer, in a pleative of those who
knows the shortcomings and weaknesses of the soul:

God of mercy!

If any success seeks me, let me realize your kindness about the weakness that
I still am.

God of mercy!

Help me keep the longing to find You.

When there is turmoil, around me, it keeps my inner silence in which
try to hear your voice.

Before others, consent, Father, to mark the infinite love to you,
valuing insignificance, through those who grant me affection.

If opponents appear in my way, make me see them as being
instruments, among those with which you perfect me.

In joy, induce me to discover your paternal protection, stimulating me to
move forward.

In pain, my ears strengthen me so they can hear the calls of peace.

And the more I may know, in my disworth, the enlightened resources of the
ocean of worlds and beings you have built in the Universe,

Grant me, God of mercy,

That I have the simplicity of the water drop that, though only anonymous drop
of water, feels quiet and happy because one finds himself able to reflect the light on the
eternal brightness of Creation.
