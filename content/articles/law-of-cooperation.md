Higher spirituality teaches that isolation is contrary to nature
Human.

According to her, the man is instinctively gregarious for providential reasons.

He needs to progress and progress is always the result of the collaboration of many.

As a rule, man seeks life in society for personal reasons.

It turns out that creatures have different abilities and characters.

Through conviviality, they take advantage of reciprocal talents and learn a
with the others.

Precisely for this being, the strength of a society comes from the diversity of its
Members.

When diversity is valued, there is a dynamic social organism and
Efficient.

On the contrary, every attempt at uniformity, with intolerance to the different,
implies weakening.

It can be understood that a general law of cooperation is in force in the human sphere.

It presents itself in the most varied contexts, from trivial to sublime.

For example, Jesus incarnated on earth to teach and exemplify the experience of
well, in the conformity of divine designs.

Endowed with extreme wisdom and purity, he still sought companions to
help him in the task.

He chose twelve Apostles, to whom he taught the most varied teachings.

He guided them, circumvented them and supported them so that in due time they would sustain the
experience of the Gospel in the world.

The Apostles were different from each other.

There were reflective, the exalted, the emotional and the practical.

Jesus despised it. Before, he knew how to take advantage of his different skills
for the success of the Evangelical endeave.

Certainly, in doing so, the Divine Master signaled the importance of
cooperation and tolerance.

Endowed with unknown magnetic powers and extraordinary wisdom, nor
that's why I wanted to do it all by myself.

He knew how to share the weight of the task with rude men who didn't understand Him well.

This eloquent example demands for reflection.

Life in society is not always easy.

Among people of diverse visions and skills, sometimes discussions arise and
Disagreements.

It turns out that the thriving good is never the work of one man.

Every realization of importance is always the result of the effort of countless
Involved.

You just have to be tolerant to live with the different.

In order for the best result to emerge, it is important to learn to admire opinions
Divergent.

Not only tolerate them, but value them, in what they have positive.

Undoubtedly, it is possible to act alone in the struggle for an ideal.

It turns out that when multiple hands come together, the good multiplies and expands.

Think about it.
