Technology has been allowing us to communicate more and more, with a
always higher number of people.

Social networks, mobile phones, are some of the mechanisms that keep us
contact each other.

Once, to talk to someone, it was necessary to be with this
Person.

To know your position on some subject, we would have to wait for a
meeting for the exchange of ideas.

Thus, the possibilities and quantity of the draft opinions were reduced.

Few were the chances of exchanging experiences, or analyzing other points of
View.

It's not the current reality.

We were able to express ourselves in countless ways, in a radius of action before
Unthinkable.

Social networks echo our opinions far beyond what we think.

Similarly, we are achieved by the opinions of so many, close or not to
our circle of friendship.

It is natural that we do not always agree with the opinion of others.

Sometimes it's political positions, or the view on government systems.

At another time, we find ourselves ahead of postures that we believe are
foolish, or even foolish.

Many express opinions that we deem unreasonable, inadequate.

In these moments, the opportunity is born to develop tolerance in us.

In the 18th century, Voltaire, a celebrated humanist philosopher, said he could not
agree with none of the words anyone said, but would defend even the
death the right of this one to pronounce them.

And so i did it because it had clear the full perception that everyone has the right
to express their ideas.

To the extent that tolerance and respect for the expression of other people's thinking
if it does, we gain the same right to express ourselves.

Being tolerant of each other's thinking doesn't force us to accept what he thinks.

To be tolerant is to have the understanding that no one is obliged to think and act as
Do.

Each of us brings its values, its concepts, its worldview.

So we choose our political posture, our religion, our values.

And will always be born of tolerance our ability to well live with the
diversity, without generating divergence.

Maturing before life will make us live with the different, without needing
impose our differences.

To each one his beliefs, his values.

To all of us, respect for each other, offering the freedom to think and
act we desire for ourselves.

If someone asks us for the opinion, that we position ourselves, clearly, honestly and
Respectful.

In the mores, we will be involved in discussions, which will always be the exercise of
imposition of our point of view on the unrelated.

These days of conviviality of ideas increasingly intense and frequent, are also
days of invitation to foster tolerance.

Without it, the war takes, the disputes are fierce, the families divide, the
friendships fall apart.

Let's think about it.
