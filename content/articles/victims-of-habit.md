There are people who find it very difficult to make small changes in
their habits.

People who have their things well tidy and in the right places, always in the same
position and preferably in the same order.

They always follow the same paths, attend the same restaurants and ask for
the dishes already known.

They always find the same friends, fans of the same team, and talk to the
working in similar professions.

They usually listen to the same radio, watch the same television channels, and
vary programming little.

In a way, it makes them feel safe. Risking is not your character.

On the other hand, people like this end up being victims of habit and have great
difficulty in solving problems. Unless they're already known problems.

This generates anxiety, depression and low self-esteem when they need to find
solution to unexpected situations and your creativity is requested

Oh, if these adults could see each other when they had the resourcefulness of their 5 or
6 years old...

It was an age when creativity sprouted all pores.

There was no solution to any problem. There was no danger that it was not
away with a shot of water, with his toy revolver.

There was no war that could not be overcome with some paper balls,
flung with a stretch band stretched at your fingertips.

Now they're business executives, men and women...

People who need to show seriousness.

However, they forget that seriousness does not mean politeness or lack of a
smile on the lips.

These reflections remind us of a seventy-something boy, man
public, respectable professional recognized worldwide, which has fun
playing with a bilboquê, or walking on the swing.

We can even imagine the happiness of his grandchildren by seeing grandpa playing like a
Boy...

This man is an illustrious Brazilian teacher, psychiatrist, educator and writer.

No one imagines that a man like that is not a serious professional just because
did not murder the boy who ran through the backyards, made pirouettes and plummeted
branches of the trees from time to time.

We cannot believe that this professional is less competent just because all
times that feels insecure, calls the boy who inhabits his being, and this comes and
Give him the hand.

We can imagine just the opposite: a great ability to solve
conflicts and problems.

A person like this has great creativity, lightness and satisfaction in all that
It does..

His writings exude a soft garden scent in bloom. Your ideas flow with
the softness of the spring morning breeze.

That's people that the world needs.

Confident, cheerful, honest, uncomplicated, light men and women...

### Think about it!

Seriousness is a characteristic of the spirit. A smile doesn't destroy her. A
closed face does not guarantee it.

Think about it, and consider that the child who dwells in you can help you
find the happiness you've been looking for for for a long time.
