Two major figures of Brazilian music once composed the following
Verses:

Every stone in the way you can remove. In a flower that has thorn, you can
scratch yourself. If good and evil exist, you can choose. You need to know
Live.

The song expresses a great truth. Life is made of choices.

All of us, daily, come across people, situations and facts that
instigate us, demanding a positioning.

There are no one who passes the roads of the world without stones in their way.

None of us can fuel the illusion that there will be no thorns that
may hurt, even if lightly.

What is up to us is to choose how to face such situations, such as dealing with stones and
Thorns.

Some of us believe that the best way to face these situations is to
having as motto the eye by eye, tooth by tooth, according to the records of the
Old Testament.

In other words, if someone makes life difficult for us, do the same, both
as much as possible.

If we are victims of malevolence, betrayal, slander, to architect situations
to reciprocate in the same way.

If it is rudeness, bad education, the lack of civility that someone imposes on us,
immediately adopt the same posture, repeating what we were targeted at.

However, we forget that, as poets sing, evil and good are
there are, we can make our option.

If we are victims of evil, if any inconvenient situation catches us, either
whether ordinary or serious things are worth reflecting.

It is important to stop and analyze the occurrence. It's valuable to ponder before you act.

Often, we feel provoked by unpleasant situations, we react by
impulse to, at the next moment, repent for the consequences that
catch up with us.

Without reflection, weighting, we have the less instincts and behaviors
noble, which we still bring as patterns of attitude and action.

So what's up to us, as the song suggests, is knowing how to live.

Among so many possibilities to act, it is necessary to know how to choose.

If we let ourselves be carried away by the trampling of circumstances, by the limitations and
difficulties of others, we will have no other result other than difficulties
and problems.

Knowing how to live may simply be changing our attitude towards life.

In the face of slander, we remain worthy, acting properly, supported by the
quiet conscience.

In the face of someone's rudeness and decomposure, we offer the patience that
awaits, kindness or silence, that disarm people.

In the face of betrayal, cowardice and error, we offer understanding, which
relieves; we work forgiveness, which dulcifies; we wait for the time, which offers
Weighting.

Let us remember The Wise Words of Friend Jesus: 
> You've heard: you'll love your neighbor and hate your enemy. I, however,
> I mean, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.

All this, concludes the Master of Galilee, that we may become children of our
Father.

In short, we live well to live more peaceful and happier.
