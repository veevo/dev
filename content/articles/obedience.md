In his Letter to the Hebrews, the Apostle Paul of Tarsus wrote about obedience
from Jesus to God.

He stressed that Christ expressed His submission to the Creator's will until the
extreme sacrifice.

And that after the crucifixion, became the means of salvation for all who
Follow.

It is interesting to reflect on obedience.

We all obey someone or something. We live in the world, subject to
rules and rules that dictate to us the appropriate way of conducting ourselves, in order to
Act.

We obey standards at all times: in traffic, in the profession, at school, in
society, in dealing with others.

However, many of us cannot understand that respect for laws
constitutes virtue and brings benefits to ourselves.

We do not understand the need to submit with dignity to compliance
of the duties that life presents to us.

We resent the burdens that are incumbent on us and seek to abandon them.

With this attitude, we meet the lower impulses of nature and, for
resist ing the intimate work of self-elevation, we become rebellious.

Almost always, in our hearts, we transform obedience which, in the saying of the
Apostle, he would save us in the slavery that condemns us.

The Lord of Life has established the gradations of the path.

He instituted the law of his own effort, in the acquisition of the supreme values of life.

In His extreme kindness, he elaborated a very good way to find the
happiness and let us plenise.

Determined that man, to be truly free, accept His sacred
Designs.

However, we often prefer to meet our condition of inferiority and
we have determined for us a true bondage to our passions.

Important that we carefully examine the field in which we develop our
tasks and ask ourselves to whom we truly obey.

Will we be serving human vanity first?

We will be, before and above anything, acting according to the opinions
Others?

Or we can accommodate our feeling in the quiet fulfillment of duties
that we are responsible for?

There are often the temptations that the world presents in the way of those who want to
live righteously.

And we have excuses for almost everything, be it abandonment of the home, marital betrayal,
tax evasion or little dedication to children.

It is always possible to find some justification, albeit insignificant, for
we can freely pass through the wide door of perdition.

The problem is that in this process we compromise not only the dignity itself but
also our spiritual future.

Each of us, through his actions, builds his own destiny and always
the time will come for us to assume the consequences of the acts committed.

In moral terms, there are no acts without consequences.

The sacrifice of one's own fantasies and vains in favor of good yields fullness
and light, just ahead.

On the other hand, the experience of passions, in a selfish climate, brings an inevitable quota of pain and
Disappointments.

Jesus taught and exemplified the experience of love, in a regime of purity.

Only obedience to His teachings allows us to break the bondage of the world
in favor of eternal liberation.

Let's think about it and be willing to follow him, our Model and Guide.
