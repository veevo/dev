There is a great number of people who live looking for miracles for the most
various evils that afflict them.

We say they're looking for miracles because most people look for something that might be
ingested, injected, smelled or passed on the skin and makes wonders.

And the recipes are not lacking: Turnip is good for this. Carrot to that. Coffee
cures such a thing. Such a vitamin prevents aging. Such vegetable gives birth
hair, such an herb prevents the fall. And so on.

We're always looking for something that solves our lives. And good would be that a
capsule was sufficient for all the evils that take away our peace.

However, our searches are always from the outside to the interior, when the
ideal would be from the inside out.

We try to slow skin aging with vitamins, and we forget that the
best remedy for this case, is our mood for encouragement.

Optimism, hope, joy, voluntary and disinterested work are
excellent against free radicals.

Prejudice, personal interest, selfishness, hatred, hurt cause wrinkles
in the body and diseases in the soul, problems difficult to treat.

Anger, revolt, desire for revenge are real poisons to the heart.
They can cause serious heart problems and even lead to death.

Envy, jealousy, malevolence, slander are bombs that destroy without leaving
Traces.

Here are some points that deserve, yes, attention and care, because they concern
to our well-being.

Little or no results we will have to ingest products, food or medicine, if
we do not treat intimacy, purifying the source of emotions.

An unbalanced emotion can cause our body very badly.

Therefore, it is important if we want to maintain health and well-being, to establish
some basic care that preventad a number of evils.

A good read, a good movie, a walk, frequent walks, a good night
sleep, play with children, laugh, jump with joy, meditate...

The healthy conversation with friends, the visit to an ailing, to an hospitalized child,
a few minutes of attention to an orphaned child are excellent prophylaxis for
various evils.

That's easy to prove. You must meet people who do jobs
volunteers for pleasure. They are smiling, do not appear how old they are and
generally do not get sick.

They don't have time to speak ill of other people's lives, they don't keep hurt, they don't carry
hatred, they do not feel envy or jealousy, and are always good with life.

These people are also different in the environment where they work
professionally, for they are light, optimistic, and their beauty sprouts from within to
Out.

People who only think of themselves are grumpy, prevented, live
armed against everyone, do not trust anyone, and usually appear older
of what they have.

For all these reasons, it is worth investing in your well-being in a way that
efficient and lasting.

Only then can products, food and medicine cause the results
expected, because they will have as a contribution a force that comes from within,
potentiating its salutary effects.

Scientific and technological advances are levers that can make true
miracles in all areas that produce well-being, but to help us with
efficiency, depend on our intimate disposition.

Think about it and start taking care of yourself, correctly and effectively.

You can do it. And only you can, because when it comes to caring for the source of life that
exists in your intimacy, it is a job that no one will be able to do for you.

Take care and take care of your health, always starting from the inside out...
