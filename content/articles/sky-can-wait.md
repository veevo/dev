Why do doctors today believe faith heals?

With this title, the magazine Seleções, from August 2001, published a
based on clinical evidence that faith is efficient ally in the recovery of
and in the prevention of diseases.

Hundreds of studies and research document the link between faith and health.

According to statistics, devotion promotes several positive effects. Here are some
Them:

1. Longer life. A survey conducted in the United States with twenty-one
1,000 people, between 1987 and 1995, found a seven-year difference in
life expectancy among those who never attend religious cults and
who attend them more than once a week.

2. General well-being. In a research co-directed by epidemiologist Jeff Levin,
author of God, faith, and health, elderly who considered themselves
had fewer health problems than non-religious ones.

3. Better recovery. Patients comforted by faith presented
three times higher probabilities of survival after cardiac surgeries
according to a 1995 study by dartmouth school of medicine.

4. Firmer heartbeats. In a study conducted in India in 1997,
participants, mostly Hindus, who prayed regularly had seventy
percent less chance of suffering from coronary heart disease.

5. Lower pressure. In a 1989 study conducted with four hundred men,
researchers at Duke University observed a significant protective effect
against high pressure among those who considered religion very
important and attended the church.

6. Good mental health. Attending places of devotion is related to lower rates
depression and anxiety, according to a 1999 survey by Duke University, which
included almost 4,000 seniors.

7. Less stress. People under stress have increased blood pressure
and heart and respiratory rates, reducing immunity, according to Dr.
Herbert Benson of Harvard, author of The Relaxation Response.

He found, in several research, that both meditation and prayer, Tai
chi chuan and Yoga provoke an opposite reaction to stress.

As we can see, according to medical research, faith contributes in a
efficient in the treatment of human beings, not only in relation to diseases
physical, but also those of the soul.

It is evident that the mind is the real agent of health or disease because it is the
great governor of the body.

And science is humanity's great benefactor, discovering diseases and
promoting healing, now also admitting that there is an important component in the
treatment and prophylaxis of diseases: faith.

Einstein, one of the most respected scientists the world has known, said that
there should be an alliance between science and religion.

According to him, science without religion is paralytic - religion without science is
Blind.

When modern scientists manage to cross the cultural precipice created
over time between faith and science, undoubtedly this approximation will
benefit all mankind.

Faith has the essential function of providing strength to solve problems for the
rather than push ing them away or free the believer from the testimonies necessary for his
Evolution.
