O uso de drogas é um problema de grandes dimensões em todo o mundo. Atinge
jovens e adultos, destruindo vidas e desestabilizando famílias e a sociedade.

The term drug is popularly limited to illicit drugs, but we cannot
forget that alcohol and cigarettes, although sold freely, in the greatest
countries cause hard-to-reverse addiction.

The subject today gains visibility due to the large number of users and the
serious problem of violence accompanying illicit trade.

It is very common to speak that the user of any drug is a victim, whose
will was totally destroyed by the need for the chemical.

This statement compares the human being to an animal devoid of reasoning,
will and self-control.

Let's not forget that before he was addicted, the individual decided to experiment.
Then he decided to repeat the experience by liking the sensations, pleasure
and at that moment he made a conscious option.

Usually vice principle in young age. Almost always, as a
parents, we usually deny reality, perhaps by comodism, perhaps out of fear of the
attitudes to be taken to curb the continuity of the problem.

Over time, when large sums of money are consumed, or when it occurs
domestic violence, it is common for us to feel victims.

Many wonder ed why our children fall and did not discover the
cause in the family bos.

However, an in-depth analysis of family members' behavior may reveal
rarely admitted causes.

How do we behave before the law? Do we respect, without exception, the
laws of our country or do we often disrespect some of them,
living naturally with illicitudes?

How do we behave in the face of violence? We are conniving with small acts of
physical or verbal violence that occur in the family environment, or of
social?

How do we behave in the face of moral vices such as envy, ambition,
Corruption? We try to get rid of such habits or give ourselves to them without
fight for improvement?

How do we behave in the face of socially acceptable vices such as smoking and
alcohol use?

Children who see us use alcohol or cigarettes, with the highest
naturalness, do not envision any problem in using them, even before the
of course, facing chemical dependence as something normal.

How do we behave in the face of the growing movement of legalization of the use of
Drugs? We agree, we are indifferent or engage in peaceful movements
and organized in the opposite direction?

Having children is a real mission. Few of us, when deciding to embrace the task,
we put aside wrong habits or abandon the selfishness of our pleasures.

Any attitude of ours is perceived by the child since the early years of
life, when the personality of the individual forms and when bad trends
can be corrected. Children tend to act like their parents.

If we expect our children to be correct, worthy and
respecting the laws, without moral or physical vices, we must excel in being
just like that.

Let us reflect, therefore: whether we embrace or wish to embrace the task of educating a
son, is there nothing to change, for the better, in our attitudes?
