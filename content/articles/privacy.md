Currently, there is a lot of talk about the right to privacy and intimacy.

It is argued that it is essential for the human being to keep an area of his life away
of any interference unrelated.

The laws of our country protect intimacy and privacy.

They guarantee the inviolability of households, bank secrecy and
communications, among others.

However, many people take advantage of legal protection to commit crimes
and harm third parties.

When caught, they invoke, as a defense, the secret aspect of their action.

The extent of these rights is a question at issue in the context of the
human courts.

However, there is a need for reflection on privacy, considering a context of
a little wider.

The tranquility of social relations presupposes limits and restrictions on what is
Shares.

Men still carry excessive moral fissures, whose integral revelation
would cause many quarrels and constraints.

The physical body, with the limitations of perception it provides, functions as
peacemaker element.

In the context of living land, the communication of ideas takes place by a deliberate act of
Will.

Thoughts are not immediately shared.

The sender of the message must gesture, speak or write, so that it is
Captured.

But the planet is not inhabited only by incarnate Spirits.

The contingent of disembodied Spirits living in it is very significant.

They stay with men, frequent their homes, share their ideas.

Doors or locks don't stop them.

In the spiritual sphere, language is thought.

To convey an idea or a feeling, there is no need for gestures or
Words.

Just think.

So everyone has a cloud of witnesses around them.

There's nothing totally secret about what you do or think.

Friends and enemies of the other plan of life always follow everything that occurs.

There is only one limit to this intense share and it consists of
moral superiority.

An inferior Spirit cannot hide anything he does or thinks of those who
are superior.

On the other hand, the superior Spirits share with the lower ones exclusively what
Want.

This rule also applies in the exchange between red and disembodied.

A structured home based on noble values is not freely franchised by
Frivolous spirits.

A vibratory barrier prevents the desecration of an honorable person's intimacy
and with pure habits.

Only noble entities have access to decent environments and they naturally
respect the intimate moments of the incarnates.

Thus, it is advisable to reflect on what you do in your privacy.

If you make levity or be adept at malevolence or pornography, learn
that a multitude of like-minded Spirits witness their deeds.

They are part of their life and share shamelessly of their most secret
Moments.

If you don't like that perspective, there's only one alternative left: moralizing yourself.

Reform your proceed sand live with purity and dignity.

In this way, only ennobled spirits will have access to their home.

Think about it.
