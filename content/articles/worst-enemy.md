A man, admirable for the qualities of work and the virtues of character,
was perceived by the enemies of humanity that we know out of ignorance,
slander, wickedness, discord, vanity, laziness and discouragement.

Together, they plotted to act against him, leading him to defeat.

Ignorance began his persecution, presenting him to the people as bad
observer of religious obligations.

He said he was isolated by taking care of the land, full of unmeasured ambitions for
enrich at the expense of others sweat. He had no faith, nor respected the good
costumes.

The active farmer received the news from the opponent, smiled calmly and spoke to
sincerity: Ignorance is excused.

Slander then arose and denounced it to the authorities for spy interests
Strangers. That man lived, almost alone, to better communicate with
vast gang of thieves.

The police service dealt with thorough investigations and, at the end of the investigation
shameful, the victim claimed without hatred: Slander was wrong.

And he worked with doubled moral value.

Soon came the wickedness, which began by burning the field to him. Destroyed him
huge milharais, harmed his vineyard, polluted his supplies.

The tireless worker all redid, answering: Against the shadows of evil, I have
the light of good.

The pursuers, recognizing that they had found a robust Spirit in faith,
they instructed the discord, which began to harass him inside his own house.

Taunts surrounded him from all sides and, soon, brothers and friends the
Abandoned.

The good man suffered a lot but raised his eyes to heaven and said:

Oh, my God, I'm alone. However, I will continue to act and serve on Your behalf.
I'll forget about the discord.

Then came the vanity that was telling him:

You're a great hero. You've overcome afflictions and battles! You must win the halo
of the righteous and the saints!

The sincere worker remained unfazed:

I'm just an atom that breathes. All glory belongs to God!

It was the turn of laziness to caress his forehead, with treacherous hands:

Your sacrifices are excessive. Rest. You've already lost the best strength!

Vigilant, the challenge replied without hesitation:

My duty is to serve for the benefit of all, until the end of the fight.

Moving away from laziness, discouragement came.

He didn't attack from afar or a close time. He didn't sit in the chair to talk,
neither whispered to his ears. He entered the heart of the operous farmer and then
to settle in, he began to ask you:

Why try? Why serve? You can't see that the world is full of
competent employees? What reason justifies such a fight?

Wouldn't it be better to leave everything on God's sake? What do you expect? Everything is useless... No
Do you remember that death will destroy everything?

The strong and valiating man, who had triumphed from so many fights, began to hear
those interrogations, lay down and spent years without getting up.

                                   *   *   *

Let us not allow discouragement to prevent us from living, acting and dreaming. Always
that we perceive him around, put ourselves in prayer, stating, My soul is
bigger and stronger than you.
