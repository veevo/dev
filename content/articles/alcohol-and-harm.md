The current world is very concerned about the use of heavy drugs like cocaine,
crack and others, and there are several fair reasons for it. Such drugs harm and
they destroy man physically and morally in no time.

But there is, running on the outside and winning the race, another drug that is accepted
by society: it is called alcoholic beverage.

The research shows the alarming rates of young people and adolescents
drinking alcohol frequently.

And the age group of initiation to alcoholics is falling, that is, children already
make use of them.

To the point that this socially accepted drug arises in the lives of individuals
even before the 15th birthday party.

The reasons that lead alcoholics to be so sought after by the kids are
Simple.

They find themselves in a period when the approval and admiration of friends, the
class, it's very important.

Drink because so it makes it easier to get to the girl, it's easier to laugh and stay
in the wave.

The most worrying is that neither parents nor young people are realizing that the
addiction is prowling. Young people believe they can stop whenever they want. That
are not, nor will they be dependent.

The World Health Organization estimates that 10% of adolescents who drink are
will make alcoholics. And 30% will have problems with health, traffic accidents
and other more or less serious consequences.

You can't imagine that it all starts with what seems to be the innocent beer.

It is common to scene in the late afternoon: teenagers, young people and adults around
a table, in lively conversation, watered with chopp or beer.

The bottles accumulate on the table while throwing conversation away.

Parents themselves do not normally see any danger or problem in offering the
son to beer. How to watch football without her?

How to go fishing without the icy blonde?

However, alcohol abuse in adolescence causes many problems in the
psychological development.

At this time, the teenager has frustrations and anguish and, drinking, loses the
opportunity to face them. Which doesn't allow you to mature. The alcoholic
becomes a cane.

How many men need a drink, a birita before closing a
important contract, to go to the meeting for the realisation of a large
Business?

Important that parents become aware of the problem and rather than adhere to
in the fashion of all allow, in the field of drink, to exemplify the
Abstention.

First of all, not drinking. Second, not serving. Third, not acquiring.

Some people who don't drink anything that contains alcohol because they say no
enjoy, keep in your home to serve friends, varied liqueurs and wines,
whiskey and beer. They are even in an all special place, in a privileged place of
Room.

It would no longer be feasible to offer his friend what is best and not that
that sooner or later can destroy it?

It's time to think. And think hard. Think about it.

Alcohol inhibits censorship by causing people to lose self-control and
Self.

The reason for this behavior is precisely in ethanol, ethyl alcohol used in the
beverages, which is a repressive substance of the Central Nervous System.

The behavior change occurs, even when used in small doses.
