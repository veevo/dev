A man invests everything he has in a small workshop. It works day and night,
even sleeping on the spot itself.

To be able to continue in the pawn business, with great regret, the jewels of the wife.

When you present the final result of your work to a large company,
tell you that your product does not meet the required quality standard.

Does the man give up? No!

He returns to school for another two years, falling victim to great enjoyment by
part of his colleagues, and some teachers who think of him as visionary.

Is the man upset? No!

After two years, the company that had refused him finally closes a contract with him,
however, during the war, its factory is bombed twice, and great
part of it is destroyed.

Does the man despair and give up? No!

Rebuilds its factory, but an earthquake again devastates it.

Is that the last straw? Does the man give up? No!

Immediately after the war follows a major gasoline shortage throughout the
country, and this man can't get out of the car or buy food for the
Family.

He panics and gives up? No!

Creative, as usual, he adapts a small engine to his bike, and comes out
to the streets.

The neighbors are amazed and everyone also wants the so-called bicycles
Motorized.

Demand for engines increases a lot, and soon it runs out of merchandise. Decides
then set up a factory for this brand new invention.

As it has no capital, decides to ask for help for more than fifteen thousand stores
scattered throughout the country. As the idea is good, it gets support of plus or minus five
1,000 stores, which bring the necessary capital to the industry to it.

Shortening history: today, Honda Corporation is one of the largest empires of
Japanese automotive industry, known and respected around the world.

All because Soichiro Honda, its founder, did not let himself be slaughtered by the terrible
obstacles you encountered ahead.

                                   *   *   *

If you experience difficult times, like almost the whole world, don't be discouraged
and persists.

Life holds a wonderful prize for those who persist, who have faith, and
that is not shaken by discouragement.

What we know is a drop. What we ignore is an ocean.

And if even after a lifetime of persistence, you can't
enjoy the desired material comfort, know that you have achieved something much greater,
much longer lasting than the treasures of the Earth.

You have conquered one of the treasures of the heart that we call virtue.

                                   *   *   *

Anyway, the hours follow. Use them in a dignified manner, even if the
weight of sacrifices.

When you transpose the barrier of difficulty, you will notice the advantage of
to have persevered, discovering himself rich in peace, in the face of the treasures of love and
realization it acquired.

No reason should support discouragement.

Everything in life is an invitation to advance and gain values, in
harmony and the glory of good.
