Under any pretext, the empty hour may be allowed.

Justifying tiredness or deception, irritability or boredom, intimate despair
or lack of stimulus, avoid falling into the discouragement that opens clear in the action of good,
favoring the uselessness and inspiring pernicious ideas.

If you assume that everyone turns against their higher purposes, insist
in the activity, which will speak more efficiently than his words.

Coerced by the stagna, change his mental attitude and renew the task, surprising himself
with new motivation for the continuation of the ideal.

Victimized by intimate, disturbing injunctions that get rooted in his past
spiritual, redouble efforts and act confidently.

Work is, alongside prayer, the most efficient antidote against evil,
because it gains incalculable values with which the Spirit corrects the
imperfections and discipline sand.

The dangerous moment for the determined Christian is that of idleness, not suffering or
the rough struggle.

In idleness comes and evil grows. In pain and task they shine the light of prayer
and the flame of faith.

Malevolences and intrigues, vanity and presumptions, slander and rumors, spite and
discredit, restlessness and fear, depressing thoughts and temptations are born and
feed during the "empty hour".

Criminogen germs of many evils that negatively weigh on the economy
society develop during the minutes of unemployment and idleness.

The unemployed never have time for others, attacked by the
indolence and the uselessness that foster selfishness and develop the
Indifference.

See that in nature there is no idleness. Everything works, everything collaborates. Life
stirs everywhere. The movement is universal law in everything present.

                                   *   *   *

Rest is part of the Labor Act. The body needs to redo itself. The mind
needs to reload.

Avoiding idleness does not mean working without rest, without respite, in a way that
Some.

Escaping idleness means just avoiding uselessness. Man can very much
well rest from one task performing another. While redoing the body, it activates the
Mind. While resting the mind, he exercises the body.

The popular saying is true: Empty head, devil workshop, meaning that
we have no ability to deal with the idle mind. It attracts bad thoughts and
awakens our bad trends, besides being more easily influenced by
those who wish to see our collapse.

Our time here needs to be very well used, because it is scarce, passes
very fast.

Therefore, the more we deal with noble thoughts and tasks, the better
for the formation of our character.

Everything in the Universe is useful, and useful always. Going against it is delaying
our happiness.

Even in moments of tiredness, exhaustion, let us look for something useful, which
build, not allowing us the simple empty hour.

Rest is not in doing anything, but in changing activity.

Futility, never!
