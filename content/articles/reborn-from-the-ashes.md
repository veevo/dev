The term resilience shifted from the world from physics to behavioral. In
principle, translates the ability of a body to deform on behalf of
external and then recover.

In the behavioral field, the role of resilience corresponds to human capacity
to face, overcome and emerge strengthened from adverse situations.

Being resilient is a process that activates within us according to the
needs imposed by life difficulties.

We all have this tool and it is strengthened through the characteristics
personal effects of each one.

Such characteristics determine our way of seeing a situation
painful, as well as the way in which we react before her.

A young woman who became a widow in the final stretch of her pregnancy wrote:

A man has a sudden death two months before the birth of his only
Son. So this blog is born, trying to understand and explain two feelings
opposites and simultaneouss lived by the widow and mother, who, in this case, am I. A
hurry to talk to Francis about his father, about the world, and about myself.

In order to cope simultaneously with two emotions so strong and contrary -
on one side the mourning and, on the other, the joys of motherhood, she created the blog, the
in order to tell her son the stories of her and her father.

I didn't want to stop living in mourning because I had just become a mother. And
I didn't want to help but be happy that You just said goodbye to my love,
her account.

Later, the stories turned into a book, entitled for
Francisco.

Resilience.

Each day is a new opportunity in the face of dreams to be realized, of the
objectives to be achieved, the limits to be exceeded.

The challenges are numerous, it's true. The pains sometimes enormous, seeming
almost unbearable. The tears, countless.

However, suffering is responsible for making us discover who really
we are, distancing ourselves from the illusions we have about ourselves.

When we think we are poor, the challenge of the minguadas material conditions in the
teaches that the little is always more than enough.

When we complain about our family, imperfect and disharmony, the tears
the late one who returned to the other plan of life show us the
how happy we are in the company of our family members.

When we forget our friends and, selfish, we refuse to be in your
companionship, the pain of loneliness reminds us that God's hand reaches us
through our neighbor.

                                   *   *   *

Mythology tells us of a bird of bright, golden feathers and
red-purplish who, after living many years, as he approached his death,
goes into self-combustion, reborn from the ashes themselves, some time later.

What do we lack to be reborn, smile and be happy?

We can, in the light of resilience, turn the tears poured out yesterday
in this ability to see all the possibilities of today, tomorrow and
Ourselves.

                                                                Let's think about it!
