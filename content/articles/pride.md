One of the biggest difficulties facing humanity is pride.

Destructive Chaga, settles in our intimacy and does not allow us to
let us release easily.

When reason warns that it is better to forgive, pride manifests itself overlooking
preventing attitude.

When the heart manifests the desire to extend the hand of fraternity, the
pride and holds the gesture.

If consciousness warns us of the misconceptions committed, pride springs
sovereign and makes us believe that only others are able to be mistaken.

When the warning comes from outside, through a friend or family member, immediately if
pride is present and prevents us from accepting any observation contrary to the
our position.

Thus, pride, holding hands with selfishness, constitute the two wounds
society.

Two wounds intimately rooted in souls, which prevent them from seeing the
true path of happiness.

Usually pride usually disguises itself with self-love and the selfishness of
Security.

It is worth distinguishing well from one thing from the other, so that we do not be mistaken in the evaluation
of our feelings.

Pride is arrogant, full of empphius, and always leads us to despotism.
We want everyone to respect us and act like we're the prototype of
Perfection.

The proud ponders nothing, or if he does, he does it for convenience.

Self-love, on the other hand, has the face of softness. He who loves himself acts with love to
with their fellow men.

Self-love is very distinct from pride. The proud does not forgive, for finding
that everyone should respect their pseudoauthority.

Self-love, on the other hand, sees in the fellow a true brother. Realizes that if your love
is capable of self-forgiveness, it is also from forgiveness to other people's failures.

As for the confusion of selfishness with social security, it is important that we pay attention to
our most secret intention.

If, in terms of conditions, we only think of ourselves or our families, and forget
of those who walk in the world without any recourse, that's not welfare, but
Selfishness.

If we are each other's supporters, we are forgetting the Law of Society,
which is one of the Divine Laws.

It's important that we think of ourselves and ours with social security. But it is also
that not just in us and our thinks.

If we are all brothers, our vision must be broadened to cover the whole.
And if we can effectively contribute to the well-being of our
to do so with altruism.

                                   *   *   *

Only the brave can triumph from pride and selfishness.

It is often said that the brave does not take care of home. But, in fact, the
courage and true superiority are in the tolerance of an injury and not
in the review.

It's so easy to react to an offense. It is so common to return the change with the
same coin. The difficult and therefore less common is to show the other face. The face
of softness, tolerance, true greatness of character.

Let's think about it!
