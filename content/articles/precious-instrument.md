It is quite common if you hear references to the pursuit of fortune. Thinking so, there are the
who act crazy and lose the goods in various games, wishing to possess more
and more.

Lotteries and other easy ways to raise values are thought, because all
wish to have a great treasure.

However, for all who are born on earth, the Divine Father has given a treasure
Invaluable.

It's the physical body. Affectionately conceived in the intimacy of the woman, starting from
a tiny egg, it turns into a sixty trillion complex of
cells as an adult.

Among the many spectacular organs that make up it, the brain, and only he, is
formed by more than seventy billion neurons.

He controls all the functions of the organism.

If we want to cross the street, in a place where there is no traffic light, we look at
one side and the other. If we see that a car points in the street, it's quickly our
brain that calculates, without realizing, in a fraction of a second, the distance
of the vehicle, the distance we have to cross and determines the pace of our
step or tells us that we should wait for the passage of the vehicle.

Because it is a very special machine and machine, the body is equipped with
a self-repair system.

Ask us to rest when you need to, determining the number of hours for
recovery due. It asks us for fuel in the form of clean air, healthy food,
triggering mechanisms of their own.

We have a stomach in such a willing way that if we feel hungry and think of
eat a pizza, so the stomach prepares to receive and perform digestion
of a pizza. If, on the contrary, we feel the aroma of a steak in preparation, all
it is available differently, to the point of feeling mouthwatering.

The blood, which runs throughout our body, travels for almost one hundred and seventy
thousand kilometers of arteries, veins and vessels to bring food to all
Cells.

Such a valuable instrument is strong, to overcome great struggles and challenges. Has
an incredible elasticity of adaptation. At the same time, it is fragile,
perishing and decomting quickly.

That's why it demands care for us. Nourish him without exaggeration. Vitalize it with
worthy, high thoughts, so that he does not impregnate himself with toxins that he
would undermine energies and poison vital possibilities.

Respect him in public or alone, not displaying him vulgarly, because he is the
temporary home of the Spirit.

Use it well, allowing you long walks and physical exercises, which the
help stay in shape, yet not wearing it in crazy night.

Let us not destroy it by the vice of any nature, even those that society
considers tolerable, acceptable.

Let us serve him in such a way that we never have to repent, when the
disease to achieve it by our own recklessness.

One day, when we leave him on earth, we will thank God for the gift
that he was, by so much that allowed us to progress, do and accomplish.

Let us therefore love this divine instrument, and become through it, a being of
intense light, living and learning always.

                                   *   *   *

The body is a valuable instrument that the Creator grants to the Spirit to
progress for millennia.

Loving the body, respecting it, using it wisely is what competes with us.
