The flags they raise are different. The causes they embrace are the
as many as possible. However, his noble intention is always the same: support
and become a useful tool in such an individualistic society.

We see, on social networks, groups of mothers coming together to exchange
experiences, to defend minorities, to demand rights in that or that
sphere, giving great example of citizenship and fraternity.

Just say you need something, or bring some special need or
of some known of his, that mobilization is immediate and astounding.
All you can do is. Nothing is impossible.

From food, through children's clothes, objects, furniture, to
medical professionals who meet a particular specialty. In a group
great, someone always knows someone who can solve.

And that's not just in the field of material or information shortages. That's if
extends to the emotional field too, because they become friends, even many of them
not knowing each other personally.

Mothers of special children, for example, who go through delicate moments
facing the first experiences, not knowing how to deal with it or
they find in the other companions on their way to the necessary shelter to
know they're not alone.

Exchange your day-to-day experiences, doctors, therapists indicate,
educational toys, courses. They create a large database useful for the entire
Group. All in a natural, spontaneous way, in a climate of great friendship.

Mothers with teenage children, who have not yet figured out how to deal with certain
behaviors, which have tried therapies, conversations, punishments, find far away
- but at the same time so close -- other little mothers who go through the same
Agonies.

Talk; exchange experiences; help themselves; they hear themselves and thus find forces
not to give up the task so important that the Creator entrusted them.

Mothers of petitions; mothers of marches; mothers of meetings with directors of
schools; mothers of emails to politicians; mothers who have no time for anything but
they can get a little time for each other.

All for the great love they dedicate to their children.

That's fraternity, that's the purest expression of love. That is the spirit of
new era that arrives.

That is why the new technologies have come to us, so that we could
give them a noble, useful end to all.

Mirror us in the case of these amazing mothers and their unusual disposition
to assist the next one.

Evil still scares us. However, let us remember that the good, mobilized, will be
insurmountable, whenever we want.

                                   *   *   *

Mother fighter,

Serving is a noble form of love.

And every second dedicated to your son,

It's a little flame that lights up in your soul.

That's why every mother's soul is enlightened,

Unmade moon light, reflected,

But like the star light, conquered and deserved.
