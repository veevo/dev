In his preaching, Jesus largely used the parable stake.

Through them he taught moral teachings to a rude people, still unable to
assimilate the great truths of life, in all its purity.

Under the veil of allegory, lie reutilizing teachings.

Each one extracts from the parables the lesson compatible with its evolutionary state.

But the essence, always consistent in the need for an honest and
fraternal, is accessible to everyone.

As the creature grows in understanding, it notices new developments
of the same evangelical passage.

Using an expression of Christ, he begins to have eyes to see.

The Parable of last-minute workers is well known.

In it, Jesus speaks of a vineyard owner who employed workers in
several moments of the day.

In the end, everyone muttered equally.

So who worked only an hour won the same of who started the task
at dawn.

Proportionally, the remuneration of the last contractors was much higher than the
of the first ones.

Because it is an allegorical teaching, it can be extracted from it as a variety of
Lessons.

One of the possible approaches is to compare workers with all involved
in the moral reform of humanity.

Over the centuries, they have succeeded.

Prophets, legislators, administrators, jurists and thinkers were the most
Different.

The difference in remuneration may be referred to the result obtained with the task.

At first, the creatures were very rude and quite refractory to the
Teachings.

Over the centuries, they became more receptive and malleable.

Today, the civil laws implemented by Moses seem quite severe.

For example, the rule of the eye-by-eye sounds intolerant to man's ears
Modern.

But for the time it was a great and important innovation.

Until then, the unmeasured revenge was in force.

In the face of an evil done, it was not uncommon to eliminate not only the offender, but all the
his family.

The proportionality of reprisal represented a moral advance.

As the people still could not forgive, at least if they had a limit on the
review.

And so gradually humanity has evolved.

Countless people have dedicated their lives to this mister.

Things that today seem natural are the result of great struggles and renunciations.

Labour rights, gender equality and ban on penalties
are some examples.

It can be said that early-time reformers worked on the basis of the
Building.

Today it is already active in the summit, as humanity is ready to
experience fraternity.

News about cruel and dishonest acts shock, for in the intimate most of the
population wants other experiences.

In short, it's the workers' turn at the last minute.

It is necessary to take the ideal of living in a better world and act so that it
implant on Earth.

It is urgent that good men show the strength of their character and occupy spaces.

It is necessary that children be educated to love work and
honesty and live fraternally.

But more than just beautiful speeches, examples are needed.

The generous reward of effort will be the chance to live, and later
rebirth, in a righteous and fraternal world.

Think about it.
