Jealouss need no cause for jealousy: they're jealous, nothing more. Jealousy
it is a monster that is generated in itself and is born of itself.

William Shakespeare presents in his work Othello, a deep, uncomfortable analysis
and intense of this great giant of the soul, jealousy.

In the classic Shakespearean piece, Moorish general Othello is poisoned by the
mistrust, coming from the sharp and sneaky verb of his ensign, Iago.

Iago, also out of jealousy and envy, seeks a way to destroy his love and his
desdêmona, and finds in this powerful toxic way of promoting his
soldade.

Trying to find out more about this human fragility, let's understand jealousy
such as mental unrest caused by suspicion or fear of rivalry in the
human relationships.

It's a kind of distortion, an exaggeration, an imbalance of the sense of zeal.

Entering the intimacy of this feeling, let's find out he's fear. Fear
to someday be expendable to the person we relate to.

Fear of being abandoned, rejected or despised. Fear of no more
be important. Fear of not being loved anymore, in short, is, in a way,
fear of loneliness.

Psychiatrist and psychotherapist Eduardo Ferreira Santos reveals that such feeling
is totally geared towards himself, egocentered and, by this statement, we can
understand why Shakespeare's iago character phrase said that the
jealousy does not need external causes, which is generated in itself.

His inner causes, according to the Spirit Joanna of Angelas, are found
psychological insecurity, low self-esteem, pride
overwhelming that does not support rivalries.

And in selfishness, which still makes us see those around us as
posses.

The insecure being transfers to the other the cause of this insecurity, saying that
victim, when he is only a slave to absurd ideas, fantasies, illusions, created
in his mind, which set fires in imaginary occurrences.

Aggravated, this feeling leads to psychoses, neuropsychiatric problems, such as
different types of cerebral dysrhythmia, causing physical aggression and
crimes.

Jealousy is a warning sign, showing that something is not going well, that something needs
be repaired, rethought.

The therapy for jealousy goes through self-knowledge, when we perceive the
fragility in us, and we take practical attitudes of self-control,
self-discipline, to eradicate it gradually from life.

Treatment also prescribes a reconquest of self-esteem, trust in itself
even by making us less sensitive to the cruel attacks of this moral addiction.

Finally, actions in good, which cause the soul to give and broaden its range
relationships, also collaborates significantly to educate the feeling of
exacerbated and restless possession.

Love doesn't need the salt of jealousy to temper relationships. The taste of it all
sound relationship will come from unrestricted trust and altruism, which thinks
always in the good of the other.
