Drugs are narcotic, exciting, hallucinogenic substances used with the
purpose of primarily and, on a provisional basis, to provide the user with a
supposed psychic state that seems pleasant to him.

Pharmaceutical substances are also called drugs, the end of which is to soften
of pain, the healing of diseases, the well-being of convalescent.

On a day-to-day basis, when something goes wrong, one of the most used words,
possibly, be it: Damn! What the hell!

The emphasis on pronunciation, as much or more characterizes how much that is
Bad.

Drugs, pharmaceutical or not, used lightly, induce
change in consciousness. Users call them trips.

Travel that leave, return, serious sequelae of physical and psychic order.

Unfortunately, the number of people who consume them is quite expressive.

Medical, religious, government institutions have been concerned about these
statistics that demonstrate contempt for life, the devaluation of oneself.

What will become of our tomorrow, when youth give in to addiction, forgetting
values of intellectuality, personal achievements, enrichment of the Spirit?

What will be our tomorrow, as children, who should be kicking ball,
grating knee in bicycle falls, races, prefer to get high, to
to feel the pleasure that these activities would provide to them, without contraindications?

What will become of our tomorrow, when adults give in to such an addiction, forgetting
of the nobility of struggles to achieve what they dream?

What will ultimately be our tomorrow, when the elderly, who should be in the
passing on the wealth of their experiences, they decide to embrace drugs,
forgetting values and affections?

What's going to be...?

                                   *   *   *

While the concern grows in this sense, no less worrying is the
other drugs that have been destroying friendships, institutions, homes.

We talk about the anger that vitalizes petty revenge, snarizing their spears
against people who do nothing more than think of the good of the next.

We remember the envy that destroys excellent quality programmes, the only
goal is to comfort hearts, soothe spirits, to concite optimism.

All because the envious decides that it is easier to destroy than to strive for
reach the level of the other and shoulder with him, in the same and worthy struggles for the
Similar.

We remember the wickedness that establishes intrigue, spreads the cizânia of lies,
destroying the honor of noble people and puts suspicions in total tasks
Resignation.

This way of acting, in the deaf, in the dead of night, throwing petardos here and
there, in a subtle way, it is a drug that also produces many harms.

For all this, if you do not want to contaminate yourself, nor serve evil, think a
Little.

If the information comes to you, distilling poison, about people and institutions,
use your common sense.

Analyze what those who are being accused do, their works, their deeds.

Put on the balance of weighting what you hear from the accuser, his acts, his
Attitudes.

Think that while the other is acting in good, this is sowing the intrigue, the
be.

And then, with lucidity, be not allowed to inoculate by the drug of anger, envy,
of evil.

Vacine with vigilance and prayer, as directed by our Master
Jesus.

Don't make trips around the country of shadows. Don't be entangled by evil.

Always serve good. Vibrate in good. Spread good and infect to many, with your
willingness to get it right, to be better, in full awareness of his thoughts
and acts.
