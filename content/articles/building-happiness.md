Discouragement weighed on his shoulders, like never before.

Although she tried to be optimistic, seek the best of each situation, for her,
those days proved challenging.

Inside the home I found misunderstanding judging all his actions.

At work, the unmeasured demands of a intolerant chief, asking for more and more
But.

And the usual financial difficulties, balancing on the budget between there
and the debts and commitments made.

That day, the afflictions seemed to take a more intense volume, the
get out of his heart.

That's how he found old friend, who always had been his counselor in the hours
crucial.

Recognizing her in the face the pains that the soul passed, invited her to a
fraternal conversation.

It seems that this world is not for happiness. "She vented right away.

Are we condemned to pain, torment, difficulties? We have no right
to be happy? " He questioned, with his voice embarrassed by the tears that
insisted on flooding their eyes.

The friend, deep knowledge of human nature, spoke, with tranquility:

I don't know what you're talking about. I see you, right now, building
your happiness!

You've got to be kidding me, you can only... You don't see my condition, you don't realize what
Am I passing by?

Still, I insist, you're building your happiness. Many people
call happiness the easy smile of social parties, or the money spent
to collect goods, or the amount of possessions on your behalf.

That's a happiness that soon fades... As soon as the money changes hands, the
health no longer allows extravagances, and illusions are closed in a blow
of pain.

There are, yes, those who travel along narrow roads, in challenging
Evidence. However, all well understood, properly experienced evidence, builds
virtues in our intimacy.

And the virtues we are conquering will be the permanent source of happiness that
we can enjoy without fear when they are permanently implanted in us.

Today you go through misunderstanding in the home. But that's where you're developing
patience.

At work, he faces the intolerance of the rampant boss. But that's where you get
learner of humility and understanding.

The financial difficulties that arise give you the opportunity to be measured,
patient, resigned before life.

On the most troubled days, in the most intense difficulties, we are performing
the efforts necessary to cultivate the noble virtues and values of which
We still don't have it.

To imagine that being happy is having money, buying everything you want, or giving flow
to all our extravagances is foolish of our emotional immaturity.

To conclude the conversation, the old friend pondered:

Remember that the pains and difficulties you are going through, soon more
will no longer exist.

However, the virtues, insculped to hard blows in these difficult days,
will accompany you forever.

A brief silence was made between the two. She looked at the friend, hugged him, and,
snuggling up to him, as someone who feels he has found a safe haven,
Thanked.

He was renewed to continue in the fights, facing the difficulties.
