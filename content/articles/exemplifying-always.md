It is narrated that, once, a young Indian woman, wishing her son had
enviable health, decided that it would be important for him to stop eating sugar.

He believed sugar was a product that attacked the body. After all, he
made it possible to appear in caries, as well as being a product that would provide the
child a few pounds more.

For a long time she told her son to stop consuming the product. But, the
child loved sugar and did not disthink it, delighting in the sweets more
Varied.

Finally, the mother sought the Mahatma Gandhi and told her problem, asking that
he, with his great authority, spoke to his son. Sure, he would be heard
and attended by the boy.

The wise man didn't say she was right, not even wrong. However, he asked him for a
15 days. After the time, she should return with her son to him.

The woman is gone, with her soul packed by the softest hopes. The days
took a while to pass. Until the day was set to put an end to the anxiety of the
indiana.

She took her son by the hand and took him to the presence of Gandhi, who was slow to
talk to the boy for over an hour.

After the dialogue, Gandhi said goodbye to the little one and returned it to his mother.

The woman was very curious. And as soon as he could, he asked Mahatma why
he made her wait fifteen days, and only then talk to the child.

It's very simple, Gandhi replied. Fifteen days ago I also consumed sugar and
needed the deadline to abandon the habit, because if i did not, i would not have
moral authority to ask him to avoid him.

                                   *   *   *

The use or not of sugar in the diet is not the most important, in the
on the agenda. What should be taken into account is the example factor.

The illustrious Gandhi did not feel comfortable asking a child to leave
to do something, if he still did it.

I did not know him that while words move crowds, the example
Drag.

Let us think about how many times we have tried to change the habits of others,
using the weighted recommendations, without holding ourselves to the
fact that we are not exemplifying correctly.

So it is with regard to the use of drugs such as smoking and alcohol, which
we claim that they attack and kill, that their use is evil, without leaving, we
same, old cigarette and appetizers from time to time.

This is also the case with regard to the frequency in the religious temple, in the classes
specific to evangelization, when we tell children that they are important,
Uplifting. But, we ourselves don't even attend the temple for study and
Prayer.

Say and do. Two important actions. The second, sure, safe weight
for the right est education.

                                   *   *   *

Jesus the Divine Master, teaching men the Law of work,
in him, working in His childhood and youth in the carpentry of his father.

Saying that we should forgive seventy times seven times, he forgave Himself the
all who wounded Him and treated Him rudely and contemptuously.

This is because, excellent pedagogue, Jesus recognized the extraordinary value of
example, never dispensing it with the educational task of beings.
