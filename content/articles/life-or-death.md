All living beings are born, we live a certain time. And we die one day.
Nothing more right on this earth. Fatal is the instant of death.

However, many factors can determine that we accelerate the time of our
death or delay.

Some think there is a day, with a right time and second to die. In
however, this does not portray the truth.

Let's see that the flowers we plant in our garden depend on our
Care. We can shorten their lives by failing to provide them with the water that
Need.

Or we can just rip them out and throw them in the trash.

Domestic animals also await us to provide them with food,
water, the shelter. How many of us have accelerated the process of death by
carelessness, abandonment or neglect?

How many do we not provide the special medicines and care they need?

And we have no correct idea how many extinct animal species we are direct or
indirectly responsible.

If we talk about ourselves, the issue is not very different.

We can accelerate our passage through this planet, handing us to vices, for
Example.

Some believe that they are simple habits, which will not cause us greater evils.

We forget that a drop of poison can cause death. And there are poisons that
we accept, daily, such as smoking, alcohol.

One and the other can cause us infirmities that will abbreviate our stay in this
Earth. Or they will, little by little, undermining vital loads, with equal results.

Also our way of reacting to what occurs to us testifies against our lives.

An explosion of anger can destroy precious energies, causing damage to the
brain, neurons.

According to a study by American scientists, bad mood,
impatience and rabies can cause heart attack.

They claim that young people, who react quickly to stress with anger, have three
times more likely to develop heart disease.

These young people are five times more likely than calm people to suffer a
premature heart attack, even without a history of heart disease in the
Family.

It is concluded that explosive temperaments can develop diseases long before
that any other risk factor becomes apparent, such as diabetes or
Hypertension.

We thus verify that our lives depend on us. Longer or shorter.
Calmer, with fewer headaches, stomach pains and biliary problems.

Or more stressed, filled with aggressive demonstrations and anger attacks.

The question is how we want to live. And the more we want to live.

Some men on the face of the Earth attest that breathing the healthy, in thoughts
and acts, cooperates for longevity.

Over the ninety or 100 years, they maintain lucidity, excellent memory. And
cooperate with humanity, where they meet.

Some constituted family, raised children, and blessed their grandchildren and great-grandchildren,
leaving them an example of nobility and dignity.

All stuffed with great calm and lots of love.

Let's think about it and love each other. We love our body, our working instrument.

Let us love our life, divine talent that has been given to us for the realization of the
Better.
