My father works incessantly. And I work too.

This phrase of Jesus was pronounced more than two millennia ago and sums up the
essence of our life on Earth.

But, you may be wondering: Our life on Earth boils down to the
Work?

Yes, but not to this work that enslaves the creature, which divides the family and
consumes health.

We talk about the work that is an effort towards progress.  Material work
sustains the body, but it is not limited to it.

Every action is work. You can work well, you can work for God.
You work for love.

Therefore, work is a way of manifesting love for God and others. As
do that?

The answer is devotion. Who truly loves God, correctly uses his
life on Earth to work as a form of retribution to all
gifts he receives from the Creator.

Some confuse physical work with the work offered to God.

Some imagine that offering their work to divinity means going out the world
converting creatures to a particular religion. That's not what we're in.
Talking about.

Working for God is to become a living example of ethics, kindness, joy. It is by
example that we provide the best services to the Creator.

What it is worth constantly speaking of God, if our actions belie our
Words?

The heart needs to be full of compassion, charity, tolerance and joy for
demonstrate the value of our belief, the extent of our faith.

Another way to work for God is to give a Divine meaning to all our
acts, words and thoughts.

It is to face the trials calmly and certain that there is, in difficult situations,
a great learning for us.

Devout men are serene not because they have received from heaven a calm
Miraculous. They are serene because they receive all episodes of existence
as a gift that will enrich its existence.

They have learned to trust God so much that nothing confuses them, angers or
Bothers. They see God in all things.

Even in the face of perversity and hatred, they understand that those are only
manifestations of ignorance. They know that God also forgives and gives repeated
chances to His children.

Therefore, negative situations do not shake the man who has true faith.

This attitude is a superior form of work. A refined, full,
High.

Forms of Divine work arise every day in our lives. They manifest themselves under
the form of a family suffered, complicated, demanding, ungrateful. In this case,
our job is to serve more, educate, forgive, understand, assist.

There is so much suffering in the world: patients caring, children to treat, elderly to
talk, hopeless inmates. The field of work is vast.
Enjoy it.

Seek to make your life a focus of action in good, of joy to serve.

Don't expect rewards, no recognition. Do the good deeds simply
as gestures of reverence for Heavenly Father. And so you'll be closer
Him.

Believe me, there is no more perennial joy or happiness more complete than
feel close to God.

Love Him simply, feel him the beneficial presence, unparalleled affection.

This is the ultimate goal of our existence: to see God, to be with Him,
fulfilling the perfect Laws to him. This is love.
