In a certain passage of the Gospel, Jesus states that the door leading to the
salvation and that few find it.

A hasty reading of this passage could lead to the conclusion that the
vast majority of humanity will fatally succumb, the victim of its misconceptions.

However, it is necessary to consider that Jesus also said that none of His
sheep would be lost.

Combining these two passages, it is concluded that the work of redemption itself is
laborious, but everyone does.

It is the only harmonious conclusion with the existence of an Omnipotent God,
Omniscient and kind.

It is incompatible with God's goodness to imagine that He has created beings
destined for perdition.

As He knows everything and nothing can surprise Him, a single creature that
lost would already put in check His kindness.

After all, in the act of Creation, God would already know the sad destiny of that being.

Spiritism teaches that all Spirits are created in a state of
simplicity and ignorance.

Awarded the twins of all gifts, they must develop them at the expense of the
effort itself.

In the process of learning, misconceptions are committed and bad habits acquired.

However, learning and repair opportunities always follow.

Those who are seriously dedicated to learning, do so in a short time.

Recalcitrants are led by pain and disappointment.

Every misfortune caused to the similar must be repaired.

All addictions need to be abandoned.

Compassion, purity, loyalty and love of work are just some of the virtues
to be assimilated to character.

The process of its consolidation and experience is the work of the centuries.

No one becomes wise and kind in a sudden.

However, wisdom and goodness are god-imposed goals to all
Spirits.

Because they are Divine designs, they are fulfilled in each being, sooner or
Later.

When the Spirit harmonizes with divine laws, it transcends.

Purified from all addictions and ills, it departs for new stages of your journey
by infinity.

Pain and sorrows fall behind.

Your learning continues on more subtle bodies.

Freed from attachment to material things, also distances itself from the pains that the
matter cause.

The narrowness of the door referred to by Christ relates to the difficulty of
that the being faces to free himself from his passions.

The conquest of wisdom implies assimilating the real importance of all
things and situations.

Neither contempt nor attachment, but wise use.

Money, food, sex and power, all this is useful and good in the measure and
right context.

In the work of Creation there is nothing intrinsically wrong or bad.

The exaggeration in the use of life gifts is that it causes disturbances.

The resources available to creatures are essentially neutral.

In abundance it is necessary to use with sobriety and share.

Failing, do not consume yourself in envy and repression.

In any situation, be a lover of work and progress.

For well living it is necessary to assume the posture of dedicated apprentice.

Whatever lesson life is presented, do it willingly.

Pay attention to the situations that follow in order to identify and correct
the defects themselves.

The circumvention of character itself is the greater task of each being.

The conquest of virtues and the abandonment of vices are very laborious.

But they are the narrow door by which everyone must move towards the supreme
Happiness.

Think about it.
