One day, the Man of Nazareth warned us and the Evangelist Matthew recorded, with
the certainty that we would very much need to meditate on it: Because I tell you
that if your righteousness does not exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees,
you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.

Historical notes tell us that those men cited by Jesus practiced justice
exclusively in their favor.

For themselves, their family and friends, everything. For the disaffected, the
enemies, nothing.

However, justice states that each must be given according to their merit.

When we analyze our own acts, we soon find that we are far from true justice. In
general, we are outraged by the injustice we see in the world on a daily basis.
Some engage in human rights movements and take to the streets, carrying posters,
demanding that justice be done.

We invoke the rights of those considered minorities, write articles about it, we
grant interviews, talk about the list of friends and acquaintances, in order to
alert and engage in our cause.

However, as we live in a society of imperfect men, natural that our sense of
justice sometimes comes wrong.

Our behavior states that while we cry for justice, for us and for others, our
acts are not worthy of righteous men.

That's why, when we hit each other's car, if we can, we'll run away in an
attempt to escape responsibility.

But when someone hits ours, we demand our rights. We try to surround the cause
of the accident, we photograph, take note of all your personal data, contacts,
because we want to repay the damage he has caused us.

Another example that tells us how far we are from true justice is that by
invoking our rights, we promote strikes and marches for better wages.

However, we do not remember to adjust and improve the salary of our nearest servers spontaneously.

We complain that the city is dirty, abandoned, that the competent authority
omits. However, more than once, we throw papers into the street as we pass
through the avenues we want to see clean.

Strolling through public gardens, how many times do we pluck seedlings of
flowers that we want to blossom in our own garden?

And how many times, claiming imperative need, do we park our car on sidewalks
where people should go?

Yes, we want justice, however, not to experience the basic principle: To do to
the other what we desire for us.

When we promote parties in our house, how often do we exaggerate the volume of
sound, no matter if the neighborhood wants to listen to those songs, or if
young, elderly and sick children are at rest.

Our criterion of democracy is wrong because we have a concept that only serves
us, which is against others. However, democracy proposes the right of all,
justice for all.

If we don't respect others, how do we wish to invoke justice for us?

Let us think about it and welcome Jesus' proposal of love and justice. So our
assessment of justice will be correct and accurate.
