Maybe you have said or heard the unfortunate statement: If I use drugs, the
it's my problem, and no one has anything to do with it. The drug only hurts me.

If you think that way, we'd like to invite you to do some
reflections on this, from another point of view.

You may have seen, live, on TV or in the newspapers, the sad image of a
eight-year-old child or a twelve-year-old, with a
machine gun in hand, in the service of drug dealers, isn't it?

These are shocking and depressing scenes, you're going to come around...

However, you may never have thought that, using drugs, you are putting the
money in the dealer's hand so he can buy the gun and put it on his shoulders
of these children.

You may have already seen the sordid spectacle of a desperate mother, with the
bleeding heart and his face bathed in tears, leaning over the corpse of the
dear son who was killed trying to get the merchandise to reach the
your hands.

You, who are a consumer, may not have realized, but it is one of the
responsible for the violence generated in this disputed drug market.

You, who are a drug user, even if it is from time to time, is
contributing to the corruption nourished in the underworld of drugs, and fostering
bloody dispute by the consumer, which fills the pockets of the powerful of the
trafficking, decimating lives and killing hopes.

Unfortunately, the vast majority of these consumers do not realize that the evil that
cause is far from your problem, as they claim.

They don't realize that your addiction is fed with the blood and tears of many.

In the name of the satisfaction of his selfishness, the drug consumer leaves a trail of
unprecedented blood... And you will answer for this before the Divine Laws without
Doubts.

Media reported the murder of a journalist, who was executed in blood
cold by the owners of the piece, which he had invaded, in fulfilling his duty to
committed to the truth.

The people have spoken out. There were marches, protests and requests for justice. Very much
commendable, there is no doubt.

But how many of those who wielded the flag of peace and justice will not have
contributed to that execution taking place?

How many executives who, sitting in their luxury armchairs criticize the
violence, without realizing that it is fueled by the abundant allowance that
put in the hands of addicted children.

You have to agree that there would be no this infamous drug market if not
there was the consumer.

When we see the cynical expression of a prisoner who commands the terror of
inside the prison we have to admit that he acts that way because he has his back
and you are sure that nothing will happen to you.

And you, who are a drug consumer, are financing this billionaire market,
feeding these cruel tyrants who enrich thanks to their fragile will to
face life in front and lucid mind.

But those aren't the only misfortunes an addict provokes. There are those who
happen within their own home. Those capable of tearing a heart of
mother or father, brother or son, with inconsequential and selfish attitudes.

If you hadn't thought of this issue from that point of view, think
Now.

And if you think sincerely, you'll realize that addiction is far from a
your problem alone, which only harms you.

Take an urgent review and make the right decision: boycott the drugs. Impoverish
these vultures that feed on the lives of careless dependents.

If you lack your strength, seek help from specialized professionals and
trust your heart to the one who has been and remains the greatest Psychotherapist of
all times: Jesus Christ.

Your service is free, just pick it through prayer.

If the drugs have not yet completely destroyed their critical sense, reflect
now on all this and change the course of your steps.

We're sure you'll make it.
