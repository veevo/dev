Ekaterina lives in Russia with her parents. From an early age, he revealed skills for the
Painting.

Running the brushes through the screens, landscapes emerge harmonious: the sky
light, inviting gardens, serene-natured animals, meek sea and
Pacific.

Undoubtedly, a remarkable but not exceptional talent for a girl of ten
years quite disciplined.

This, were it not for the fact that i have suffered, since the age of three months, dystrophy
muscle, rare group of degenerative diseases that affect muscles,
making them impossible to develop properly, which causes weakness and
numerous deficiencies.

Currently, little Kate can no longer talk, raise her arms, breathe
on its own and bear the weight of one's own head.

She uses a wheelchair to get around and in order to help her
overcome its limitations, does several therapy sessions, which takes you great
part of the time.

However, while the abundant commitments her fragile health demands, Kate did not
forgets your love for art.

When she lay down, her parents gently saw her aside. One screen and multiple
paints are positioned right next to your tiny body. Brushes are put
in his dereal hands.

Silent, for an instant, she contemplates the blank canvas, possibly
giving wings to your imagination. Little by little, landscapes full of harmony and
tranquility are emerging.

Kate's talent is remarkable. However, without profiting from your ability, your parents
decided to donate their works to different institutions, in particular those
care for children.

The struggle of the little one and his family causes admiration from countless people.
Daily, they receive numerous messages of support, which are read to Kate
by your mother.

The gentle girl flashes with light eyes and, with a sweet smile on her face, returns
to his paintings, portraying what is happening in his inner world, so
full of meekness and peace.

                                   *   *   *

The truth is that we all suffer morally from the most
Several. Pride, selfishness, vanity and so many other ills still
make gifts in us to a greater or lesser extent.

Participants that we are of our own creation, it is our duty to overcome the
limits of ourselves, through personal effort, intimate reform,
practice of good.

Jesus, brother, friend and guide of humanity, bequeathed us the watercolor with which
we can color our existences, grayed out by moral faults.

For vanity and pride, the noble ink of humility. For selfishness, the
delicate color of charity. For the lack of forgiveness, for impatience, for the
hurry to judge the next, multicolored tones of love.

Loving, we renew forces, we circumvent faith, exercise charity, make ourselves
wise, we fortify the Spirit in motion, become brothers.

                                   *   *   *

Love is paint that never dries. The more practiced, the more colorful it becomes the
our lives. Let's get out of the shadows, the gray, the monochrome: let's love it!
