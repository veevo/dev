Chinese bamboo (bambusa mitis) is a plant of the family of grasses, native to the
East.

We highlight here a very interesting particularity, relating to your
Growth.

After planting the seed of this incredible bush, you see nothing for
approximately five years, except a slow blossoming from a small bud to
from the bulb.

For five years, all growth is underground, invisible to the naked eye.

What no one sees, is that a massive and fibrous root structure, which extends
vertically and horizontally by the earth, it is being carefully built.

Then, by the end of the fifth year, Chinese bamboo grows, until it reaches height
twenty-five meters.

                                   *   *   *

How many things in our life are similar to Chinese bamboo...

We work, invest time, effort, dedication and sometimes we don't see
result for weeks, months or years.

Who knows, if we remember this lesson that nature gives us, through bamboo
china, we will have the patience necessary to wait for that fifth year.

So we will not fail to persist, to fight, to invest in ourselves, knowing
that the fruits will come with time.

Many are still immediatists, desiring easy return, conquest
Instant.

We forget that all the great and valiator achievements of the soul require time,
require effort from many and many years and sometimes many lives.

This habit of not giving up our goals, of continuing to try, of not
to shake in the face of the inevitable obstacles, constitutes a virtue.

Continue, persist, maintain constancy and firmness, are part of the
very important virtue of perseverance.

Perseverance is the fuel of the winners.

But not from worldly winners, superficial and transitory victories. But
of those who overcome themselves, who overcome difficulties in anonymity.

Tomas Edison, persevering man, said our greatest weakness is in
give up, and that the surest way to win is to try again.

And how many hundred times he tried to manufacture his lamp, to no avail... And the
more interesting is that the many failed attempts gave him more strength
Still.

I didn't fail. " He said. I found 10, 000 solutions that didn't work out.

At another point he stated that the three great fundamentals for achieving
anything is: first, hard work; second, perseverance; Third:
common sense.

Let us learn from these exponents who have achieved much, not just looking at
the laurels of glory, or just contemplatively admiring.

Let us respect them for their valiator acquisitions, and see all the way that
they walked until they got their success.

                                   *   *   *

Don't be severe: It's impossible for me to do!

Don't give back: I can't!

Never informs: I know it's totally useless to accept.

No retricks: It's bigger than my strength.

For the one who believes, the impossible is a task that only takes a while to be
carried out, as possible can be carried out immediately.
