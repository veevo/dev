If the night surprised him from an injured heart or brain whipped by bitter
regrets, you do not surrender to the pain that seems irremediable to you...

As the shadow extends along the way, and the wind blows, which
sorry cry of anguish, look at the stars that sparkle in the heights and follow
ahead, to meet the new day.

Can't you? Do you shake your feet under the burden of distress? The fibres of
your soul and can't nurture a new dream?

Raise a prayer to hope, this genius of light that allows us to anticipate the future
Immense.

Gather to prayer and she will come, sweet and indefatigable nurse, ferry her
the inner wounds and sustain the half-dead energies.

Answer his affectionate appeal and proceed without demise.

Do not allow the narcotic elixir of inertia or corrosive fel of the
suffering weakens him.

Accept the friend genius's suggestions and reflect...

You will feel in your own heart greater pains than yours, the pavors of the great
unfortunate, the cancerous ulcers of millions that, so far, you had not managed to
See.

Then, ineffable comfort will lower from heaven upon his pain, quieting his eagerness.

Inexpressible feelings will blossom in his Spirit, and his arms will
will open up to welcome the ignored pains of the most humble beings on earth.

Not everyone knows how to evaluate this heavenly virtue. Many turn it into vinegar
impatience or mortal torture, converting the blessing into stiletto of the
Illness.

Happy, however, of those who keep him the sublime clarity at the heart of the
Spirit, because it will see the wisdom of time, acquiring with life the science of
Peace.

Wait! - say the night - The day will come back.

Wait! - cries out the seed - The fruit soon.

Wait! - announces justice - And Everything Will help.

Blessed, therefore, how many in the world know how to learn, serve and wait!

                                   *   *   *

Courageously support the burden of your pain, advancing on the road of life
heroically, even if it's an inch a day...

Remember that today, the maternal night will wipe your weeping with the home.
mandatory, and that tomorrow the day will return, renewing all things.

Remember, furthermore, that hope always arises with the first rays of the
aurora.
