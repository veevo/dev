Man often becomes what he believes he is.

If I insist on repeating to myself that I can't do a certain thing,
it's possible that I end up making me really unable to do it.

On the contrary, if I am convinced that I can do it, I will certainly acquire
the ability to accomplish it, even if it does not have it at first.

                                   *   *   *

The words attributed to Gandhi are a great incentive for the soul you want
Grow.

Intimate conviction determines the world we create outside of us, determines what
we are and what we can be.

According to the dictionary definition, conviction is this certainty obtained by facts or
reasons, which leave no doubt and do not give rise to objections.

We could then question: How can I achieve such intimate certainty? Where
can I get such facts, such reasons?

Well, if we want to start with the facts, we can do an exercise in
memory, and remember how many other achievements we've made.

We can scour in the past, and realize that we are victorious, for already
we survived many scourges, and with that we gain more strength.

What many call faith in themselves may be based on facts, yes.

We often seem to forget how many things we have achieved with our
determination, our willpower, our insistence.

We have victories in our history, yes! You have to locate them, and make them
foundations for the next.

                                   *   *   *

Now moving on to the reasons, the question to be examined would be: What reasons
feed my certainty of getting, to be able?

We can find such reasons in the Universe in the first place.

Everything in the Universe, in all its elements, breathes evolution.

All laws, which govern every event in it, proclaim evolution.

In this way, we will understand Goethe's statement: The Universe conspires to our
Favor.

Yes, everything conspires for our evolution, for our growing constant and right.

As much as certain facts and experiences seem, in a first assessment,
disasters, evils and misfortunes for no reason, a more comprehensive and profound view
will show us no.

All the experiences of life, from the most beautiful to the saddest, make us
grow, put us on the rails of the law of evolution.

This will make us note that we will always have reason to believe in our success,
for he's right.

When are you coming? Here's a question whose answer is everyone's.

To believe in our strength, to have conviction, is to believe in God, in the most beautiful and
mature possible.

To believe in our strengths is to understand the laws of the Universe and to be enchanted by
them, day after day, in their most amazing details.

If a sincere conviction dwells our souls, we will discover ourselves capable of
unimaginable things so far.

We are potential gods discovering our powers.



## Did you know? 

The word enthusiasm is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful invented by man.

In his etymology we will find the Greek in theus, that is, to have God within
we, have vital tone, energy.

This leads us to realize that together with our intimate forces is always God,
propelling us forward.
