Have you noticed how many entertainment alternatives are offered in the days
today?'

There are so many possibilities that sometimes it becomes difficult to choose.

However, if it is true that supply is great, it is no less true than not always
entertainment achieves the objectives to which it proposes.

Entertainment aims to amuse, bring well-being, joy,
Relaxation.

However, one must ask themselves why people go to these places of
fun and get drugged, get drunk, become violent, lose their wits, the good
Sense.

You're wondering why the seaside towns where many spend the holidays
generally become, in the "season", stressful, annoying, tiresome,
dirty, noisy.

Do you have to lose your mind?

It will be valid to seek, in the name of leisure, mechanisms of alienation of reality,
varied escapes, numbing the senses?

Entertainment should bring satisfaction, intimate peace, contentment. And all that
it is only possible with lucidity, with mastery of reason, with discernment.

When the numbness of the senses is a serious sign that something does not
okay and as much as you try to pretend fun, you can't get that
Satisfaction.

And in this case, the consequences can be even more disastrous.

The individual goes out for fun and back depressed, dissatisfied, anxious,
when it does not fall into the meshes of violence, always lurking with careless...

It is important to reflect on these issues that concern all of us.

It is necessary to reflect on the purposes that move us to seek leisure,
fun, vacation...

It is very common, in coastal cities, in summer, heavy traffic and horns
nervous making it seem that people are there upset, fulfilling a
Penalty.

Children inside the vehicles seem frightened, and should not understand
how can your vacation be so tumultuous.

Maybe some people don't realize they're on vacation. That are there
to obtain satisfaction, tranquility, peace, and not to compete in traffic,
angering and irritating others.

Others wish to take to these leisure places their "particular noise", with
which they are used to.

They speak loudly, hear even louder music, as if the world were made only to
them, and all other people should submit to their tastes and heartbreak.
When this happens, leisure becomes widespread disruption and causes
an effect totally opposite the expected.

For all these reasons, it is worth thinking about the purposes that move us to
seek entertainment.

And more importantly, it is worth remembering that we live in a world where we need
respect those who divide space with us.

If not, what's the fun of entertainment for?

### Think about it!
Remember that people seeking leisure have the same rights as you, and
everyone has a duty to contribute to the general good.

Remember, furthermore, that your right ends where the other's right begins.
Respecting this right is the least expected of a civilized society.
Think about it, and have good fun!
