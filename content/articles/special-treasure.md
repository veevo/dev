In the Epistle to the Ephesians, chapter 5, verses 14 to 17, Paul of Tarsus
cried out men in the following sense:

"Awaken, O you who sleep, rise up from the dead and Christ will enlighten you.

Walk prudently, not as necscios, and, yes, as wise, I remind time,
because the days are bad.

Do not become foolish, but try to understand what the will of the
Sir."

Paul indicated the Christian ideal as the sublime goal to be achieved by the
Man.

Saying that "days are bad", it was reported to problems, to difficulties
that, yesterday as today, mark our existences.

There are several pains that afflict our day.

Trials and atonements are constant characteristics of the world in which we live.

Therefore, we must conduct our steps with caution, not as fools who do not
they know what they're doing.

We must cultivate reflection, rescuing lost time in the truths of errors.

Time is a treasure of invaluable value granted to all, by God, in a way that
Indistinct.

The minutes, the days, the centuries have the same duration for all beings.

But how do we use that time?

After all, the way we use it is that it makes a difference, the result.

Do we use our time or just waste it?

"We kill" time, we use mere "hobbies", or invest it as a
valuable currency capable of bringing us big profits?

Wherever we are, we can acquire valuable assets of experience and
knowledge, virtue and wisdom.

To do so, we cannot allow minutes to drain unproductively.

Many people spend their lives as if they were immersed in a sleepwalking,
packed in the dream of illusion.

They let centuries take place, sowing only inconsequences and vices,
compromising the future with the inevitable harvest of suffering.

It's imperative, therefore, that we enjoy the time.

We can start by trying to correct our own imperfections.

Addictions, for example, represent not only loss, but also
future commitment of time.

How many minutes does the smoker lose a year in the nicotine puffing ritual?

How many hours do you need to work to fuel your addiction?

How many days will shorten its existence due to the diseases that take place
cigarette use?

How many years will you suffer, even after death itself, to rebalance the
Spirit itself?

What about the malleous?

How many minutes do you lose daily rambling about other people's behavior?

And how many stocks will you spend later, around with evils that will settle in you
Same?

So many options for those who want to perfect their own spirit!

So many daily opportunities arise for those who have eyes to see and
ears to hear!

Discipline words and emotions.

Rehearse attitudes of humility.

Train patience.

Expand your knowledge.

Contain the ferina tongue.

Here are some initial suggestions for those willing to apply valuablely
your time at your real benefit.

After all, God offers us the blessing of time for human experiences, but,
sooner or later, we should account to divinity, the way we use
this precious gift.

Let's think about it from now on.
