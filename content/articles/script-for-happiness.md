The human being has never felt so much need to find intimate peace, as in the
present days.

In an attempt to meet this need, bookstores are crammed with
self-help books.

There is demand, the product is offered.

Although the intention of many writers is noble, it cannot be said that all
are intended to offer help to those who need it.

What most of these authors aim for is easy profit, at the expense of the needs of
Creatures.

However, there is a foolproof roadmap for happiness, available to those who
please follow him.

This is a code, a rule of proceeding spanning all
circumstances of private life and public life, the basic principle of all
social relations that are based on the strictest justice.

But what foolproof script is that, anyway?

Are you within everyone's reach?

Can it be understood and followed by everyone?

We can say that this foolproof roadmap is within everyone's reach and can be
understood and followed by all.

This is the Good News, the good news brought by the Master wiser than the
Terra knew.

This excellent code of ethics and morals. covering all the circumstances of the
human life and brings the basic principles that can guide all relationships
is based on the purest justice.

This compendium of wisdom is known as the Gospel of Jesus.

Unquestionably, it is a foolproof script to achieve happiness.

But if the Gospel has been available for more than two millennia, why
isn't happiness still a reality on Earth?

What happens is that everyone admires Christian morals; everyone proclaims to you the
sublimity and necessity; many, however, speak out of faith,
entrusted with what they have heard, or based on certain maxims that have become
popular proverbs.

Few, however, know her thoroughly and even less are those who understand it and
know how to deduce their consequences.

The cause of this lies in the difficulty of understanding that the Gospel presents
for the largest number of its readers.

The allegorical form and intentional mysticism of language make most
read by disposition of conscience and duty.

However, they do not perceive the moral precepts, disseminated here and there,
interspersed in the mass of narratives. It is impossible, then, to understand the whole
and take it for object reading and special meditations.

However, those who have eyes of seeing perceive that all of Jesus' morals
sums up in charity and humility, that is, in the two virtues contrary to the
selfishness and pride.

In all His teachings, He points to these two virtues as the ones that
lead to eternal happiness: Blessed, said, the poor of spirit,
that is, the humble, because of them is the kingdom of heaven.

Blessed are those who have pure hearts; blessed those who are bland and
peaceful; blessed those who are merciful; love your next
like yourselves; I will do to others what you would want to do to you.

Love your enemies; forgive the offenses if you want to be forgiven;
practice good without ostentation; judge yourselves before judging the
Other.

Humility and charity, this is what it never ceases to recommend and that which gives, He
example. Pride and selfishness, here's what you don't get tired of fighting.

And Jesus is not limited to recommending charity; puts it clearly and in terms
explicit as an absolute condition of future happiness.

Here's the foolproof script. But only for those who sincerely want to invest in
your happiness.

Christ himself has placed his own free will as a condition for achieving this
goal, when he said: Whoever wants to come after me, take his cross, denied the
himself, and follow me.

There is a book entitled The Gospel according to Spiritism.

It was released in April 1864 in Paris by Allan Kardec, Encoder of the
Spiritist Doctrine is the best-selling spiritist book in Brazil.

This book brings comments from the higher spirits about various teachings and
parables of Jesus, in a simple way and easily understood.

This is a good reason to be aware of this infallible roadmap of
happiness, known as the Gospel of Jesus.
