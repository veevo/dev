Do you enjoy your life?

It is very common to listen to people and especially young people, saying they want to
enjoy life. And this is usually used as an excuse to exempt yourself from
take responsibility.

But, after all, what is enjoying life?

For some is to kill each other little by little with the comispears, alcoholic beverages, smoke and
other drugs.

For others is risking life in dangerous sports, night out of,
consume yourself in carnaium pleasures.

Maybe that's because a lot of us don't know why we're on Earth. And
for that reason, we waste our lives instead of enjoying it.

One day, a young man who worked in a public office, in the company of
other colleagues who used to meet all the end-of-office hours to
drinking and smoking at will, was invited to accompany them.

He thanked him and said he did not drink and that he also did not like the smoke of the
Cigarette. The others laughed at him and asked him, with irony, if religion did not
allowed him, to which he replied: My intelligence is that prevents me from
do that.

And what intelligence is that that doesn't allow you to enjoy life? They asked the
Colleagues.

The boy answered with serenity: And you think I would spend the money that
gain to poison me? You consider yourself very smart, but you're paying
to spoil one's own health and shorten life which, for me, is precious
Too.

                                   *   *   *

Looking at things from this point of view, we can consider that
enjoying life is to give you the proper value.

It is to invest the precious minutes that God grants us in useful activities and
Noble.

When we dedicate our hours in the wholesome coexistence with family members,
We're enjoying life.

When we do exercises, we get distracted at leisure, healthy relaxation,
we're valuing life.

When we study, work, walk, without intoxicating ourselves with drugs and
excesses of every order, we are intelligently taking advantage of our
Stocks.

When we really like something, we make efforts to preserve it.
That's also about life. And let us not delude that we will be
enjoying the end of her.

If you are a supporter of this idea, it is worth seriously rethinking in which
consists of the use of life.

And if you think the vices will save you existence, visit someone who is
saying goodbye to her thanks to a lung cancer caused by cigarettes.

Talk to those who deliver physical forces to a liver cirrhosis caused
by alcoholics.

Listen to an inveterated gluttonous that is in the prison of pain because of the
exaggerations in food.

Visit an unhappy who has lost freedom and health for drugs that the
consume slowly.

Looking at life through this prism, maybe you change your concept about
enjoy life.

                                   *   *   *

Life is a poem of beauty, whose verses are made up of proposals of light,
written in the score of nature, which exalts him to the presence everywhere.

As a result, the opportunity for physical existence is a framework for
part of enchantment and achievements, through whose learning the Spirit
embellishes and reaches the high planes of happy reality.
