No one advances along the road of spiritual progress without God's help.

Often this aid is offered to us through the noble Spirits
who have become guides of humanity.

These operososo good servers are always close to all those who
ask them for help or that, through prayer and high thoughts,
tune in with their presences.

They are aware of some occurrences that are outlined in the existences of
pupils and the challenges they must experience.

Therefore, they inspire us and guide us on the most appropriate path to success,
or warn us of the imminent dangers that lurk.

Through this inspiration is that the feeling occurs.

It is an effective way for the creature to stop and reflexionar around what it should
and how to conduct yourself, bypassing difficulties and advancing without
fear of the path of progress.

However, if the being lets be carried away by misguided and rebellious attitudes, do not
will be able to keep in tune with the superior Spirits.

Due to his mental and behavioral options, he will be under the
influence of unhappy spirits.

These, skilled in the technique of transmitting depressing ideas and content
disturbing, torment and deceive the unforeseen.

And when venerable entities seek to somehow guide them, these,
for the lack of habit of assimilating their noble ideas, refuse them, returning
to the same mental landscapes that congratulate them.

The feeling, therefore, should be analyzed with caution, evaluating
where their origin and what type of message they are carriers of.

After all, valuable guidance can be to move us away from evil, or evil
suggestions to impel us to the misunderstanding.

It is up to us to use discernment to impartially assess our conduct
the nature of the influence we receive.

There is also the possibility that the feelings are ideas of the
be, who return to the mental screen in the form of intuition, but that are nothing more of the
recalls of previous commitments made.

They resurface from the personal unconscious as an efficient way to drive the being to the
rebalancing and thus avoid ingress.

Feelings are phenomena that can greatly contribute to happiness
of creatures.

However, when negative or threatening, they should serve as a reason for
that we give ourselves to prayer and high thoughts.

Thus changing our vibratory range, we will be able to move away from
and, consequently, receive the guidance
benfazeja of superior spirituality.

Allan Kardec, the Codificator of the Spiritist Doctrine, asked, sometime, to
Superior spirits regarding the influence of spirits on thoughts and
in the acts of incarnate beings.

He was answered that this influence is much greater than one could
Imagine.

They influence the point that, ordinary, they are the ones who direct you - it is in the
answer to question number 459 of The Book of Spirits.

However, aware that such influence is usual and intense, it is up to us to learn how to
distinguish our own thoughts from those who are suggested to us.

In addition, we must keep in mind that good spirits always advise us
for good.

Unhappy spirits, however, are incapable of it.

We are therefore left to use common sense to make such differentiation and
we are only worth of the guidelines that can lead us to the path of good and
Truth.
