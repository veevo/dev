In a passage from the Gospel, it is narrated that the Apostles were in a
boat, in the middle of the storm.

In the middle of the sea, the vessel was flogged by waves and strong winds.

At one point, Jesus, who was praying on a hill, addressed himself to together
of the Apostles, walking on the waters.

The Apostles were very frightened, until Christ reassured them.

Peter asked Jesus to make him go to Him, through the waters.

The Master nodded and called him.

Peter began to walk over the sea, but was afraid and began to sink.

Jesus reached out and rescued him, lamenting the smallness of the fisherman's faith.

When the Messiah got on the boat, the wind calmed down.

This Gospel passage has extreme beauty and deep meaning.

Apart from Jesus' undeniable power over the elements, one can make a reading
focused on the transformative power of His message.

In the world, creatures suffer vergastado by the gale of their passions.

Many contract various illnesses by the lack of control in eating and drinking.

Others succumb to the toxics of various nomenclatures.

Some lose their dignity in sexual unrulerity.

There are countless vices and great damage they cause.

Gluttony, vanity, selfishness, cruelty, dishonesty and most
consequences.

Many of the creatures that are uncongratulated, would really like to live with
dignity and all wish to be happy.

Although some desatinos seem seductive, sooner or later show their side
Bitter.

The problem is that many claim to overrail to overcome their bad
Trends.

It is not possible to be naïve and imagine that moral renewal takes a pass
of magic.

Bad habits crystallized for a long time don't just disappear because the creature
decided to change.

However, renewal is always possible and runs because of the perseverance of
who wants it.

In this struggle against inner darkness, the importance of faith arises.

Peter sank out of doubt, as Christ sat.

So it is important to firmly believe that the rectification of reality itself
spiritual is possible.

Maybe there are some falls, but the belief in success needs to always be
This.

This belief will be as effective as the more based on the proposals of the
Christ.

The experience of fraternity, hope and purity is the greatest antidote to
against the illusions of the world.

When Jesus really enters the boat of someone's life, the storms cease
of passions.

Peace arises, not as a privilege, but as a natural consequence of a life
Worthy.

Think about it.
