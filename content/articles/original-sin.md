Humanity is essentially disparate in its characteristics.

Each creature has facilities and difficulties inherent to it.

Education and the environment influence human behavior.

But certain trends are unexplained in the context of a single existence.

Within the same family nucleus, there are marked differences in morality and
balance between brothers.

Some children, from an early age, demonstrate good character.

Balanced and serene, they accept with tranquility the discipline and guidance
of the parents. Others, on the other hand, bring the mark of rebellion.

Unstable and difficult, sometimes even cruel, are a challenge for the
patience of family members.

The reality is that spirits embody endless times, in their journey to the
Perfection.

Each of which is heir to himself.

By reincarnating, the spirit brings with it what it has acquired in its previous
Stocks.

That's the reason why men show good or bad pendores, which in them
they seem innate.

Virtues and vices are not works of chance.

They are the result of options made in the past.

Who struggled to circumvent their own intellect, today has advanced
Intelligence.

The one who has spent time improving artistic sensitivity currently has
ease in the field of arts.

The creature that allowed itself to minatize the treasures of life resents its
Lack.

The being that elected addiction in the past has present it in its heart.

The evil natural pendores are remnants of imperfections of which the spirit
it hasn't stripped yet.

Here's true original sin.

Human laws, though still fallible and unfair, repel the idea of penalizing
one man for what another did.

As God is sovereignly just and good, it is incoherent to imagine that he
hold on to each other's faults.

Each one struggles with the heritage he has provided for himself.

Light or shadow, facilities or difficulties, what is currently experienced is the result of the
that was done in the past.

There's no point blaming anyone for the current difficulties.

In general, the memory of past lives is not possible or desirable. But the
current trends highlight the points lacking in correction, in the economy of
Soul.

Yesterday is passed and can not be modified. But today are being launched the
foundations of the future.

This is the time to reflect maturely on the coming tomorrow, and adopt
measures so that it is luminous.

No one will do their job.

The nobility of character, intelligence, purity, none of this can be
Improvised.

If you want to be peaceful and kind, you need to create a habit of being like this.

Daily you are faced with situations that require positioning.

It is solely up to you to choose to be worthy or unworthy, courageous or
cowardly, generous or petty.

But know that you are daily casting the seeds of your future.

Think about it.
