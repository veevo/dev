In his Epistle to the Philippians, Paul de Tarsus claimed to have already learned to
to settle for what i had.

This is an interesting and very current reflection.

The vertigo of possession overwhelms most of the creatures on Earth.

Men and women lose peace and often dignity in the search for
Riches.

They multiply their activities, far beyond what is necessary, in order to have
many things.

As such a matter of doing so, they no longer pay attention to serious issues of the existence of
Human.

To have more and more, give up the conviviality with friends and family and leave
take by selfishness.

Simple life is a condition of relative happiness that the planet can
Offer.

However, she was forgotten by most of the men.

Spirituality informs that the overwhelming majority of the supplications that start from the
Earth is not elevated to higher planes.

They can't move beyond their cramped scope of origin.

That's because the claims directed at divinity often contain strangers
Absurd.

Rare people are content with the material received for the solution of their
Needs.

Very rare ask only for the bread of each day, as a symbol of acquisitions
indispensable materials.

The incoherent man does not seek to know if he has the least for the terrena life.

He often is looking forward to more in the transitory possibilities.

Generally, it remains absorbed by perishable interests.

Insane, restless, lives under the anguished torment of unmeasured ambition.

In the crazy race for immediacy, forget about the opportunity that belongs to you.

It devalues and considers little what Divine Wisdom has placed in your hands.

Olvida who was reborn to pacify and become virtuous, not to pile up
things you'll leave when you die.

With this, he throws himself into adventures of unpredictable consequences, in the face of his
infinite future.

Those who already understand the superior purpose of earthly existence need to be
strive to get out of this vicious circle.

It is of no use spending all energies on transitional issues, with
forgetfulness of the essential objective of human life.

Sooner or later, death in a simple and clear way reveals to each one what is of
important fact.

In order not to repent bitterly, it is important to analyze the essence of the
Wishes.

Makes sense to burn with greed for what will be in your hands by reduced
Moments?

It is not better to free yourself from so much attachment and pay attention to more
such as family, friends and the pains you can ease?

Many centuries ago, Paul of Tarsus lit up as he learned to settle for the
that had.

No one will do that lesson for you.

Think about it.
