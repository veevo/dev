Enemy. The word brings an impressive negative charge! The enemy is
someone who awakens in us the most primitive feelings: fear, hatred, desire
revenge.

Before an enemy, the hands become icy, the heart beats hard, the
blood pulses in the time pores. And the question arises: How to act? What to do?

The answer to this question was given by Christ: Love the enemy, sometimes
for those who persecute you.

But, we, who are ordinary people, usually react to this advice
of Jesus.

And we ask ourselves, love the enemy? Do good to those who hurt us and
Mistreated?

And in general, we conclude: Impossible. For us, the expression Love the
enemy looks like a utopia.

In some cases, we are even ironic: This teaching of Jesus is not

for us. We're still very imperfect.

What happens is that we do not properly understand the meaning of
word love, when it applies to the enemy.

Jesus was a sage. He knew the human soul deeply. Do you think
that Would He suggest something we wouldn't be able to do?

Of course you don't! All jesus' suggestions are perfectly possible.
Is that why we're going to look at this question of love for the enemy?

The first thing is to understand what the expression Love the enemy means.

With these words, Jesus only invites us to forgive those who have made us
Bad. Or, at the very least, it appeals that we don't seek revenge.

Does it look difficult? Not so much. Let's talk in a practical way.

If someone has an enemy in general what is the attitude they adopt?

Most people keep the enemy permanently in their
Thoughts. You can't think of anything but the hated person.

And so life goes on. Those who hate remain a slave to the enemy.

He dines, sleeps, wakes up, works and lives constantly in the middle
to this feeling of grudge, feeding desires for revenge.

Does that sound bad? For that's exactly what we do: we leave the enemy
command ing our lives. We become slaves to those we hate.

Therefore the wisdom of Jesus' proposal, which is the deliverance of the bonds
that bind us to the enemies.

Forgiving is easier. It makes the soul lighter, the healthiest body, the
emotions under control.

When Christ uttered the expression Loving the enemy, in fact,
offered a path of balance and serenity.

Of course, Christ does not expect us to have the same
love we dedicate to family and friends.

Jesus just wants us to turn away from our hearts the sorrow, the
unhappiness, hatred and the desire for revenge.

That's why he advised: Pray for those who offend you.

And in these prayers, I asked God to give you the strength to overcome the offense
Lived.

I also asked God to offer you the opportunity to be useful to those who
hurt you.

If this opportunity arises, let us not miss the chance to be
useful and good. Gestures of this kind give birth in the soul the feeling of overcoming,
overdue stage.

It's a unique, charming moment.

Let's think about it!
