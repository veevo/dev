Although the discouragement that takes over some hearts, there will always be reason to
if you believe in the improvement of our world.

Just look at the sun, and everything seems to lighten up.

We have a new generation full of concepts and ideas, enlightened souls that
return to the world to teach how to accomplish what we aspire to.

Let's look at the example of the eight-year-old boy who, worried about so many people
starving, set up a food donation center, in his city, in the
England.

Little Ronnie Hazlie's mother said he couldn't believe that
some people had nothing to eat.

Recently, Ronnie collected a significant amount of food, which was
donated to organizations in hampshire's Gosport region, according to The
Telegraph.

Ronnie's mother said the boy bothered everyone she knew with
donation requests.

They created a facebook event to collect food, and were received
contributions from all over the country.

                                   *   *   *

Proactive ideas and movements from a child of just eight years,
rekindles hope.

We've been through moments of apprehension and fear.

At all times, we get varied information about disasters, wars,
hunger, violence.

These facts generate anguish, depression, negative thoughts. And in the
we question: where are we going?

We recognize that this is the time for major changes on the planet.

There are negative energies and deleterious hovering in the spiritual atmosphere of the
planet and influencing people's attitudes.

Pride and selfishness are exacerbated, in a struggle for power,
to the detriment of the pressing needs of the general population.

However, there are also great advances in the scientific and
providing relief for many pains.

We note that cures are gradually discovered for certain diseases that
considered incurable.

Although slowly, our world adds improvements, making life
most viable, more comfortable physics.

But with regard to our heart, we find that we are still seeking
results out of us, forgetting to look at our intimacy, where if
find the roots of the so many evils that manifest themselves on Earth.

We still don't realize that we bring in ourselves the antidote to what we
Ails.

The correct work, the work in good, the thought in harmony with God, the
look closely around us to cooperate in meeting needs
Others.

It is important to remember that Jesus is the conductor of our planet. He told us
that none of the sheep the Father entrusted to him will be lost.

Let us trust in God, working, praying and improving our interior.

We are residents of this Earth. When we improve our habits and
to love more, to collaborate more, thinking of the other, not only in
we will be on the right track for building a better world.

Finally, we will understand that the world is better depends only on each of us. And
some children remind us of this, with their examples.
