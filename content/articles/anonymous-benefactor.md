Don't know your left hand what your right hand does. The words of the
Master of Nazareth were harvested by the Apostle Matthew and inserted in the chapter
sixth of his Gospel.

Certainly following this special teaching, is that that man, very rich,
distributed benefits.

I was prime of anonymity. Once, arriving in a small town, on business,
entered a diner for a quick snack.

He noted that among the boys who played in the street, one limped because of a
of the deformed feet.

Calling him, asked him if his foot bothered him, to which the boy replied that
couldn't run, like the others.

He also said he needed to cut a piece of the shoe so he could step on better.

Would you like to have your foot healed? "The man asked.

Yes, of course! Answered the boy, with his eyes shining.

Well, I'm going to make sure your foot is normal. " You promised the stranger.

Then he asked his driver to find out the address of the boy Jimmy,
eight years.

Then, that he spoke to his parents, obtaining authorization for the realization
surgery.

It wasn't a difficult task for the employee, because everyone knew the boy in the foot
Defective.

He found a very poor house, with patched dresses and some shirts
old in the clothesline.

It took a lot of talk to convince parents that everything was just
Frame.

After all, mom said, nobody gives anything for free.

But my boss, the driver said, usually does that all the time.

Jimmy went to a specialized clinic and underwent five surgeries.
He became the nursing shawc.

The faithful driver accompanied everything at the request of his employer, providing the
that was necessary.

Finally, the day came to return home. New shoes were
Provided.

Jimmy didn't fit in himself with contentment and anxiety.

When the luxury car stopped at the door of his house, he said:

Wait! I want to go in alone.

The parents and brothers came to the door. And a boy with faultless feet, wearing
new shoes, came down from the car and walked, smiling, with open arms, to the
meeting of them.

That Christmas, the businessman still arranged that the whole family be taken
to a large city shop, so that each of them would choose a couple of
Shoes.

Jimmy became a successful businessman, and never knew the name of his
Benefactor.

All because your benefactor, Henry Ford, pioneer of the auto industry
american, always said that it's more fun to do something for people when
they don't know who did them good.

                                   *   *   *

Doing good without ostentation is great merit. Even more meritorious is to hide the
hand it gives.

It is even a mark of great moral superiority, because it renounces the satisfaction of the
applause from men.

Those who act like this, prove their real modesty and fall exactly into teaching
evangelical: Do not know the left hand what gives the right hand.
