Some people have strange concepts about spirits.

They believe that after death, everyone becomes angels of purity and wisdom.

It's common if you hear from famous people. Many artists who come to say of the
activities in the spirit world. They talk about grit, fighting.

And people let themselves be deluded. You don't realize the lifestyle of those
Creatures. And not even the kind of death.

We've been hearing compliments for messages from one or the other.

Creatures that, during physical life, allowed themselves all sorts of pleasures:
alcohol, smoking, sex, drugs.

Some even lost the body of flesh by indirect and direct suicide.

But it comes to say they're okay. That continue to compose, that everything is legal with
They. They even talk about being protectors of some of their fans.

To believe that such messages are true, we are asked: Where the
justice of God?

For the man of good walks in the right life and will be well in the world
Spiritual. The inconsequential and frivolous too?

Surveillance! Common sense! Let's not be seduced by nonsense.

Each will be given according to his works. The statement is of Christ.

Let's convir as soon as those on Earth diluted the treasure of the body, if
will find in the spiritual world sick, in need of help, confused.

Beings who will need Divine Mercy. Time to balance.

No immediate chance of becoming guardian angels or guiding spirits.

Speaking of the feathers and rewards, the Spirits affirmed: the happiness of the
Spirits are always proportional to their elevation.

For those who delinquiat in the world, proportional penalties: the miser is
comes back with material things, which can no longer enjoy.

The debauchery with the of which he still wants to participate.

The proud envy of the honors he no longer receives. Anyway, everyone lives in the world
spiritual what lived on earth.

Death to no one transforms.

Angelic beings only those who served in the flesh, donated and carried out the
that was good.

Those who cultivated the beautiful will continue to do so. Those who created the
imbalance, disharmony, will continue to do so.

One day they'll wake up. On that day, they will begin their course for rebalancing, which is
always slow.

After all, nature does not jump, there is no magic wand to transform a bad
in good, selfless, benevolent.

                                   *   *   *

In 1969, Brother Spirit X interviewed the Spirit of Marilyn Monroe.

She died from eating pills. Indirect suicide, as it did not seek the
Death. I just wanted to get some sleep.

About his plans for the future, he said:

To the condition of sick, I want to improve. Then as a student in the educandary of the
life, I need to repeat the lessons and evidence I have failed... For now, I shouldn't and
nor can I have another goal than to reincarnate, fight, suffer and relearn.
