Forgiveness is a necessity in anyone's life.

It is a resource that helps to follow in peace the walk.

Human existence is full of mishaps and disappointments.

The disparity of personalities causes small and great friction.

Even good and honorable creatures sometimes hurt the like ones.

The very dynamics of the modern world make it difficult to give due attention to
expectations and feelings of others.

Those who allow themselves to accumulate sorrows becomes unhappy.

There's always something bad to remember.

It can be an indelicacy, a lack of attention or a misplaced word.

The man who is dedicated to seeking defects and offenses certainly finds them.

However, the same person who offended, perhaps unintentionally, also assisted
countless times.

It's a matter of choosing what you want to value.

What's more important?

Countless kindnesses or a gross expression?

The discretion of a lifetime or an indiscreet word, launched by
Neglect?

The usual generous attitude or a selfish act?

Many friendships are lost because someone claims to be betrayed.

Often this betrayal is not even very high.

It's before an unfortunate moment, than something premeditated.

In this regard, it is worth remembering the Gospel passage in which Jesus is urged to
manifest herself about the adulterous woman.

Contrary to the general expectation, the Master said:

He who is without sin throws the first stone.

The lesson is that you can't judge the one whose conscience isn't pure.

However, pure people are not encouraged to judge anyone.

In the biblical episode, Jesus merely recommended that the poor woman no longer
pecasse.

It's important to keep in mind that wholesome lesson.

Who on Earth has a totally unblemished conscience?

To condemn a selfish act in the next, it is necessary to have always been generous.

However, the very disapproval of a small slip already indicates a lack of
Generosity.

To touch yourself at length with a mean comment, it is never necessary to have
spoken ill of anyone.

Who grinds the indiscretion that was targeted signals that it has always been strictly
Discreet.

Otherwise, it is a hypocrite, who does what he disapproves of others.

In social and family coexistence, it is necessary to remember that human beings are
Imperfect.

They gradually improve over time and experiences.

In order not to become a spiteful and unhappy creature, forgiveness is a
Need.

Even when we are the target of some really low or cruel attitude, the
need to forgive.

We are all very ancient spirits, with countless reincarnations.

In this gigantic walk, we were not always happy in our deeds.

We often make mistakes, but we learn from experience and move on.

Consequently, we do not allow ourselves to be more certain rascalities, which shock us.

However, in our past, some situations call for correctness.

If any great pain strikes us, we do not revolt against who is only your
Agent.

The cause lies in our consciousness in disharmony with the Divine Laws, in our
need to experience certain disappointments.

In the face of inelutable and shocking situations, we do not veto.

The ability to forgive provides the liberation of the past and candidate for
happier experiences.

In the face of other people's misconceptions, one must forgive, silence and wait for time.
