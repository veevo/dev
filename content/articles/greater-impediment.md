It says ancient narrative, that a wise priest, desiring to teach the way of
heaven to believers who trusted him, pleaded with Jesus to be revealed to him what the
greater impediment against spiritual enlightenment.

With a clean mind, he slept and dreamed that he was led to the heavenly door.

Wrapped in splendor, an angel welcomed him, kind.

"Messenger of Allah!" - said the priest - "I come to gnaw the truth to the
human sheep that follow me."

"What do you want to know?" - asked the angelic entity.

"I ask for clarification on the greatest obstacle to the soul, in the march to God.

I know that we have committed serious faults, which annihilate in us divine grace, in the
ascension to light. However, I would like clearer explanations as to the
evil problem, because our faults vary to infinity."

The high Spirit smiled and considered, "The solution is simple. What are the
failures you refer to?"

The minister of faith moved his fingers and replied:

"Pride, avarice, anger, gluttony, envy and laziness. From them are born the others
imperfections."

The messenger replied:

"In essence, we can reduce all the faults to a single problem because all
imperfections come from a single source."

The priest, curious, pleaded:

"Angel friend, clarify my understanding!"

The emissary of the upper sphere, without any pretense of superiority, 
Explained:

"If the proud worked for everyone's good, he would not find a
cultivate the pride and vanity that lead you to believe to be the central point of the
Universe.

If the miser knew the advantage of sweat, in the happiness of the like, do not
would indulge in the pleasure of possession that forces him to accumulate money uselessly.

If man inclined to the temptation of easy pleasures he learns to use the
forces in favor of collective elevation, would have no opportunity to
attach yourself to the annihilating passions that drag you into crime.

If angry people were willing to serve according to the
divine designs, would not poison their own health with remorse and anguish
Unjustifiable.

If the gluttonous lived attentive to the constructive task that belongs to him in the world, he would not
enslaved to the appetites that ruin his body and soul.

And if the envious used existence, in decent work, I would not spend time
maliciously following the initiatives of the next, complicating the very
Destination...

As you can see, the greatest imperfection, the primary cause of all evils, is the
Laziness.

It gives uplifting work to your sheep and convinces you that, in possession of the
service, will not move away from the righteous path."

The priest had nothing more to ask.

Awakened, instructed, and, from the next day onwards, the people noticed that he
changed the tone of their preaching.

                                   *   *   *

The problem that stands out today is that of laziness.

Entrepreneurship, ease, rest, moral amolent, pleasure are condiments
that season the sloth running which rust destructive in the gears
of the Spirit, eroding man.

The determined Christian, like his Master, is active, a natural adversary and
spontaneous of this corrosive odiento, however, much required and well accepted.

When we feel, without real reasons, softness and need for time-consuming rest,
let's wake up and produce.
