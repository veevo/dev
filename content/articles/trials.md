A few days in the life of all of us are truly challenging.

As quiet as life goes its course, it is natural to emerge this or that
greater challenge to demand us the effort of faith and the courage of lucid coping.

Unexpectedly, the health of the physical body, which proved solid and unshakable,
is undermined by the diagnosis of severe disease, requiring long and painful
Treatment.

The once-family, harmonic and fraternal relationship is surprised by the visit
of death, to reach the loved one, who synthesized the emotional structure and
affective reference of so many.

The friendship cultivated long ago, in the intimacy of the heart, that kept it
what jewel in valuable safe, finds herself raped by pettiness and betrayal,
accompanied by cowardice and indifference.

Other times, life, which seemed so rich and full of meanings, in the
elects for solitude, preventing the company from affections or finding it from someone
to shoulder and walk with us on the most difficult days.

From another time, the slander visits us the days before quiet, weaving
stories and plots that do not belong to us, replicated by frivolous mouths and
foolish, hurting us the sensitivity to injury and defamation.

All these are the ordeal crosses of our walk. All of us in the world,
we carry the heavy logger of afflictions and difficulties, often in the
silence of intimacy, and ignorance in the eyes of the world.

Pain on Earth is still a process of debugging a thousand offences that have not been
justices and alarming vices that remained hidden.

Thus, God's mercy makes it possible for us to recover from the crimes of
once, debugging, by suffering, the difficulties planted by ourselves.

It will be in the country that we will reconsider attitudes, reschedule activities and
we will effectively lift ourselves for good.

Therefore, in the face of pain and difficulty, let us avoid discouragement or revolt.

Let us remember that popular adage gains reason when he says that God gives the cross
according to the ability of our shoulders.

We will never dislike the trials that come to us, inviting the renewal and
restructuring of our intimacy.

First, let us make these pains our instrument of redemption and reimbursement of
debts from before.

Thus, as we feel tied to the crosses of painful trials,
we adorn ourselves with the flowers of brotherly love, transforming today's pains into the
hope over the days to come.

With dynamic resignation, we will be able to overcome the most serious days, having
always in mind that, from the arms of the cross on which we find ourselves tied,
we will be able to lift the high spheres of liberation faster.
