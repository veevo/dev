He is recognized as one of the ten best storytellers in the world.

His own story yielded a book. And a FILM, awarded by UNESCO. Today
he is a pedagogue of almost fifty years, adoptive father of twenty-five children.

At the age of six, he ended up at the defunct Foundation for the Welfare of the Minor, taken
by his mother, who thought that would be the way to, one day, have a child
Doctor.

When he started being abused, he ran away. He was seven years old and was the
first hundred and thirty-two escapes.

He was eventually transferred to other cities and lost contact with his family.
At the age of thirteen, he was found unrecoverable.

However, a generous act showed that boy that he could make his
different story. The French pedagogue, Margherit, visiting the institution,
did not conform to that sentence.

She looked deep into Roberto Carlos' eyes and talked to him. It was the
first time someone said to him, Excuse me, please.

Margherit broke the established prognosis for that smoking boy: the
illiteracy and marginality.

She taught him to read, adopted him, and took him to live with his family, in
Marseille, France. And at school, Roberto Carlos met other realities.

He told his story, always posing as a victim. However
knew children of exiles, orphans from eastern countries, children who had
lived and witnessed wars.

He found out that he could continue to be a victim or seek to build a
different story for you.

Inspired by that woman, he later returned to Brazil,
recognizing that in his country it was his true place.

He returned to Minas Gerais, his homeland, rediscovered his mother and brothers.
He graduated in pedagogy. And it was to do internship in the same FEBEM, in which one of the
Internal.

Your biggest goal: to get as many boys out of there, so they would have the chance
to remake their lives. In two and a half years, he adopted his first eight years
Children.

And helped them rewrite their own story, using the rule: having dreams and
Plans.

He comments: No one sleeps peacefully knowing that the next one is bad. I
needed to do something.

Our family was formed with the idea that if someone's help was
fundamental to us, it is necessary to be repaid and shared. Like this
all become responsible for each other.

And the storyteller says he believes that every story may have an end
Happy. The proof of that, he concludes, is that the story I tell the most is mine.

I learned that before I was respected, I needed to respect myself.

And it was my experiences that made me what I am, an accountant of
stories and international speaker.

My work today only exists because I tell this narrative of generosity
and overcoming. The human being is predisposed to good. Just look right at
see that everyone has a fantastic resilience.

                                   *   *   *

The story of the boy, febem's record holder of escapes, is truly
Fantastic. And everything changed from an act of generosity.

Then it was overcoming, high self-esteem and willingness to repay the well received.
