The duel is a violent and unfair practice in human history.

For a long time, the legislation has admitted this genuine remnant of barbarism.

It consisted of the exaltation of the most rampant and uncontrolled pride, though
dressed in honor.

His logic was that honor was washed with blood.

However, the truly honored man does not need to kill anyone in order to
attest to that quality of yours.

Honor is a spiritual attribute of those who fulfill all their duties,
including those of humanity.

And it's inhuman to kill someone, no matter how serious the offense received.

When the duel was admitted, it was considered proof of courage for him to participate.

In fact, there was only social exhibitionism and arrogance, without any
ethical concern.

The trained duelist was just a murderer.

He was cast in the endeave aware of his supremacy.

On the other hand, what accepted the challenge knowing at a disadvantage committed suicide.

Both violated the Divine Codes.

They'd have time to regret the pride they gave.

This unfortunate practice left widows and orphans, for whose pains and trials the
duelists in the future would respond.

Slowly human legislation has evolved.

Today you no longer admit the duel.

It is understood that honor is not conquered or remains at the expense of murder or
Suicides.

But the human creature is always heir to its bad inclinations.

Ancient habits of the spiritual past do not disappear easily.

Pride, arrogance, arrogance, selfishness, hatred and resentment are vices that
still weigh deep into the moral economy of humanity.

These cruel feelings are the heritage of what has been lived in the remote past.

Overcoming them is every man's duty committed to ideals of peace and redemption.

As seen, today there are no more duels of life and death.

But the creatures keep digladiating themselves for nonsense.

Although unarmed, such clashes remain quite harmful.

They take away peace and sow tragedies.

In the home, in the workplace, in the social environment, individuals are in touch,
with great ease.

Instead of talking and getting the differences right, they cultivate sorrows and hatreds,
similarity of treasures.

So nefarious cultivation one day explodes in the form of violent discussions.

In the lack of courage to face the presumed opponent, it is not uncommon for those who
give up the maledicence.

They make the life of the disaffected hell by spreading around their footsteps the
seeds of mistrust.

Where he before saw smiles and sympathy, he goes on to confront ill will and face
Ugly.

There are still those who duele mentally, wishing evil to the one who supposedly
Offended.

Negative thoughts sometimes reach the recipient if it vibrates in
misguided track and also gives in to paddles.

But they always empest the spiritual atmosphere of those who emit them and generate malaise and
Diseases.

Aware of this reality, pay attention to how you react to taunts and
Disagreements.

Know that there is more courage and wisdom in retaking than in countering offenses.

Stop with the sad habit of duelling and offending and going to forgive and understand.

An honorable life is the best response to taunts.

Think about it.
