Fasting and prayer

Jesus had come down from the mountain where Peter, James and John had recently
witnessed the phenomenon of transfiguration.

When they reached the crowd, a man approached, kneeling down.
before Him, and saying,

Lord, have mercy on my son, who is lunatic and suffers greatly; because
often falls into fire, and often into water.

And he brought it to your disciples, and they could not cure it.

Behold, Jesus answered him,

O unbelieving and wicked generation! How long will I be with you, and how long
will I suffer you? Bring Mo here.

Then tells the evangelist Matthew, that Jesus rebuked the evil Spirit that
was with him and the Spirit left him.

The disciples came to Jesus curiously, and in particular to him
asked:

Why could we not cast out the evil Spirit?

The Master said to them:

Because of your little faith. For verily I say unto you, If ye have faith,
as a mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain: pass from here to there, and there shall be
pass. And nothing will be impossible for you.

Jesus concludes the lesson by saying:

But this caste of demons is expelled only by prayer and fasting.

                                   * * *

It is necessary to calm the soul and preconceived ideas, and to reflect deeply
on the proposal of fasting and prayer offered by Rabbi.

Did Jesus, when proposing the act of fasting, refer to stop eating
regularly?

For this is how many understand to this day. Therefore, it is necessary to
let us look at the issue from this point on.

The Master's proposition went far beyond the diet.

He had the idea of ​​moral abstinence, of abstaining from all that
leads to overeating.

He thus speaks of a fast of unhealthy behavior. This is the only way.
to release the deleterious influences of spiritual obsessors.

Prayer is paramount because it binds us to the Creator, purifies our thoughts and
elevates mental attunement.

With her, the change of behavior, direction in life purposes is
fundamental.

Unhappy spirits connect with us by tuning in to our miseries
intimate.

If we stop cultivating such miseries, if we change the mental range, we will not
there will be more compatibility in this psychic plug.

Deprivation of negative actions, evil desires must be the fast for
soul desiring to be free from any inferior spiritual influence.

Reasoned faith and action for good protect us from everything.

There is nothing to fear when the hands are fragrant with the flowers of good that
We left it by the way.

There is nothing to fear when the heart is warmed by the certainty that the laws
of God are perfect, and the Divine presence is constant in our lives.

In the face of any difficulties we may face, let us remember the lesson of
fasting and prayer. Remember this powerful medicine that we all
we have.
