The Apostle Matthew, in chapter twenty-two of his Gospel, recounts the moment
in which the Pharisees, together with the Herodians, try to disdispose Christ with
roman authority.

At a time when any criticism of the Emperor's decisions was severely
punished, priests, ingeniously, asked Jesus if it was lawful
or not pay taxes to Caesar.

Jesus, knowing his malice, asked one of them to show him the currency
used for the tribute and, showing it, questioned them about the image and
inscription contained therein. They're Caesar's, they answered.

Thus, Jesus condemned: Let Caesar what is caesar and God what is
god. Such an affirmative, so simple and so wise, was enough to surprise
the Pharisees and silence their intentions.

With this teaching, Jesus makes clear the legitimacy of our civil duties,
such as taxes and other obligations. These days, nothing more
Current.

With the advent of the Internet, the world has undergone a revolution. There is a huge flow
information. It becomes increasingly tenuous the line that separates real life from the
scorched virtual life.

Files are shared, ideas. Real-time messages are exchanged. Millions of
emails are sent every day. You sell and buy pretty much everything.
People know each other via the internet and get married.

However, it's not all flowers. A common habit of many network users
computer worldwide is to download music, videos and even
books, without paying attention to copyright and fees due.

In another sphere, taxes are snooze, which are necessary to ensure
citizens' rights, such as housing, education, health and leisure.

There are still other habits that, by such common ones, almost become natural, but that
are far from moral. For example, let's leave a few minutes before
end the office, borrow a book and not return.

Still others, how to realize that change came to oo and did not restore it to the box;
appropriate of a money found without making the slightest effort to
find the owner.

Our duties to society are as relevant as our
duties towards God. After all, if we do not seek to adjust to human laws,
how can we do so with respect to divine laws?

Let's think about it and realize how often our actions are based
cultural automatism, in which certain trends, not morally correct,
are accepted as if they were.

However, those who seek to live according to the teachings of Christ,
we must remember the evangelical maxim: Be your speaking yes, yes; No
No. That is, an attitude is in accordance with Christian morality or is not. There is no
middle ground.

Let's think about it.
