Resident in Aracaju, in the State of Sergipe, Reinaldo has been a coconut salesman for
forty-two years, in several parks in the city.

Six days a week, push a heavy cart loaded with your merchandise,
ensuring the support of his family.

Narrowly, your story didn't have a tragic ending. It was common that, time or time,
slept in the cart, sheltering under a tarp, for his residence is distant
and public transport, precarious.

That night, however, the hard-working gentleman decided he would go home. The day
it was quite tiring and he wished to rest with a little more comfort.

During the early hours, while resting, vandals invaded the square where he
he had left his cart. For pure wickedness, they set him on fire, burning,
including the products the trader had purchased to replenish their inventory.

The next day, when he arrived at the square to work, the elderly despaired.
In tears, he wondered how he would recover from that injury, how he would
sustain his family from there.

Because he is well known and loved by those who frequent the park,
many tried to comfort him, while others photographed barbarism, in order to
record what happened.

Through social networks, one of these photos came to the commercial director of a
Company.

Realizing that it was not enough just to share the suffering of others with nothing
do to help him, she started a virtual campaign to raise donations
and thus return to that gentleman what he had lost.

The worker's loss revolved around 3,000 reais. In twenty-four
campaign hours, Simone and her group of supporters raised almost twice as much as
of that amount.

After three days, the campaign was closed. After reporting by the
collection, the generous citizen wrote to those who contributed to the cause:

Gratitude to God, first of all, and to all who have supported us, that
we could return to Lord Reinaldo the hope and joy of being able to return to the
to work with dignity and a lot of battle, as he always did.

                                   *   *   *

Attributed to the philosopher Theodor Lipps, the concept of empathy is defined by the
psychological capacity to feel what the other feels, if one experienced the
same situation he faced.

Jesus, the Master par excellence, recommended us empathy in dealing with our
brothers: Love God about all things and others as himself.

It's about first being good listeners. Listening, we don't do
hasty judgments about the actions of the other. Before, we seek to understand
their reasons.

Still, and following the lessons of Christ, have eyes to see: see the next
as a one-time someone, with a unique story, who sometimes hits, sometimes errs in his
Choices.

Recognize, therefore, that we all need forgiveness, to be forgiven, the
that requires us humility.

Finally, exercise love. To perceive in the other the divine signature, the
God's countenance.

Realize that we are all fruits of the same hands and thus brothers; That
we are a divine family whose destiny is truth, happiness, good and peace.

Let's think about it!
