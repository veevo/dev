There are not among us who do not wish to have a full, fulfilled and satisfaction life.
We all invest our efforts, our time and our energy in order to have
a healthy life.

In order to live in fullness, it is necessary that we take care of our lives in
all its aspects.

Seeking this, there are not few those who dedicate hours to body care.
Balanced diets, varied physical exercises, restorative sleep hours and
so many other care aimed at maintaining the physical body.

There are those who, realizing that we are not only a physical body, but also a
intellectual, seek to invest in the things of the mind.

They are those who are always exercising the intellect, either through the habit of
reading, whether attending professional or personal update courses, all
for the purpose of not letting the mind rust.

It is true that taking care of the body as well as taking care of the mind, are attitudes
sensible, because it reflects in ourselves and in our health the good or misuse that
we make the instrumentality that has been given to us by God.

However, few of us remember that, in addition to body and mind, we are still beings
Emotional. And therefore we must also take care of our emotions in order to
health terms.

How many times have we stopped to analyze what emotions we bring into our souls?
How many times do we wonder if the emotions we cultivate are healthy or are
nocivas?

How bad can it hurt us to carry a feeling of anger or resentment
by someone? And if we carry the hurt for a poorly resolved situation, that doesn't
Will it hurt us?

Every time we realize that our diet is inadequate, before
we get sick, we modified it. We cut excess fat or sugar, decrease
the salt.

And with emotions, we must act the same way. Every time we come across
feelings that harm us, which harm us, it is necessary the same
effort, so that we may be fully happy.

If we feed hurt for someone, why not exercise understanding by trying to
put yourself in the place of those who hurt us, seeking to understand their reasons?

If our problem lies in resentment, revenge, the best antidote will be
forgiveness, which will make us unlink from negative emotion, understanding the problem
in an easier way.

If we desire full happiness, we must not forget that the same
investments made for the health of the body and intellect, should be made
for emotional health.

                                   *   *   *

Let us try to analyze carefully, at the end of each day, what feelings
who populated our hearts throughout the journey. Let us plenise ourselves when
let us find in him the gratitude, compassion, love.

But if we ever find anger, envy, desire for revenge,
let us carefully analyze its origins and seek, with tranquility,
replace them, so that health may be done in us, in the body, in the mind and in the
Heart.
