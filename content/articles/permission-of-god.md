One of the beautiful episodes of Christ's life and relevant teachings is what it says
respect for His judgment. He stays serene.

Innocent of all charges, he doesn't scream or defend himself. What good would it do
talk, if no one willing were listening to him? If it had been decided that He
should I die?

Wise par excellence, He, who had sung both the excellent wonders of the
kingdom of heaven, which weaves the most beautiful poems with the simplest things of the
nature, remained quiet before Anas and Caiaphas.

In the interrogation to which he was subjected by Pilate, Jesus replies and, of the
initial admiration, judeia's attorney now feels a secret terror
of that mysterious man.

He was used to, in the trials, to which the accused spoke a lot,
gesticulas, if they revolted against the charges, protestinnocence.

But Jesus hears with the greatest calm in the world all accusations. No sign of
Predicament. No word of protest. No explanation. As if not
were He the target of the accusatory play, but some other man far away from there.

At one point, Pilate asks, Don't you tell me? You don't know I have power
to crucify you, and that I have the power to let you go?

To which Jesus replies: You would have no power over me if it were not for you
given from the Top.

Here's the big lesson. Pilate's authority before being granted to him by the
Emperor, he had been given to you by God.

Authority by which he should respond to the Divine Law, rather than the law of
men, who can be scammed.

Consideration brings us back to the present day when man accomplishes so many things,
without realizing that if everything is allowed to him, it is by God.

We talk about the scientific experiments involving human beings, especially.

The man researched and entered the field of genetics. It made it possible to design in
Vitro. Freezing of embryos for future implants in the uterus.

And this same man, who is elevated to the condition of co-creator, is what cries out for the
destruction of so many other lives, supporting the death penalty and euthanasia.

Man perfected the machines and conquered the skies. Advanced and challenged the
outer space.

And he used the planes to drop bombs, killing his large-scale brothers.
He aims to conquer space to submit other nations.

Man is squeaking at the dome of the authority of the powerful nations of the Earth. And from there
commands peace and war, for political interests or others that tell you
Respect.

Man dominates the field of laws and establishes arbitrariness to decide who
must live and who should die.

Power. Authority. Gestures. Attitudes.

                                   *   *   *

The man has his free will to accomplish whatever he wishes. What not
can be liable to the authority and the
possibilities that the Creator confers on him.

The man is big and very can. But you mustn't forget that, above him,
the Divine Justice that reaches all to all hangs.

Authority is a chance for growth. The larger and more comprehensive, the greater the
responsibility is also made to those who are invested thereof.
