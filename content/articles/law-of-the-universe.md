Nothing stays where it is forever. Everything is renewed. Everything changes, change your
structures, changes their way of being.

This law applies to the world of matter and to the world of the Spirit.

Progress is the law of the Universe, it is natural law, and works tirelessly through the
you were revolutionizing everything and everyone.

We start from the primitive state and go to perfection. Many experiences
are necessary to circumvent ourselves, always in transformation.

In the universe, nothing can stand still.

The well-known one here, i don't leave, here no one takes me off, can't resist the law of
progress, which makes us abandon the old postures, whether or not, an hour
or another.

The so-called force of things inevitably leads us to the review of postures,
renewal of life, whether in the same incarnation, or in a new one, in conditions
several from the previous one.

Universal law pushes us forward, does not let us sleep on point, do not
allows idleness, since it is educational law, above all, commanded by
a loving Father.

Getting to earth in a certain spiritual condition and leaving equally is
defeat to the soul that needs to progress.

Therefore, every opportunity must be deeply used, each
learning, every suffering, every joy, everything needs to be collected
by us and make us bigger.

Let us see each other as apprentices, as regulars of a large school who can
say, at the end of each school day: today we know more than yesterday.

We do not only refer to the knowledge of things, of the knowledge of the intellect, but
of complete wisdom, which involves improving relations with others and
with ourselves.

The progress we are gaining is intellectual and moral. Sometimes in the search
unbridled by the first, we neglect the second, much more difficult to be
Achieved.

Intellect can be developed, in the vast majority of times, in solitude. The
morality is built on life in society, in contact with others.

The intellectual brings us enlightenment, the ability to use reason and
discern, make better choices.

Morale allows us to love better, to live well with each other and with ourselves.

Therefore, just as we draw plans for our achievements of knowledge:
what courses we want to take, master's degrees, doctorates, deepening areas,
we should also set targets for the other area of progress.

What moral aspect do we want to develop more in this life? What are the
more urgent needs?

Specialization courses, master's and doctorates in virtues are the very
life and its challenges. The family, for example, and their constant surprises, their
phases, their shortcomings.

Our social participation, our role in the world, all of this are ways of
specialize in the various virtues of the soul and be able to end the
existence better than when we got here.

Let's think about it. Our progress is also the progress of the world. If we want to see
an improved humanity, let's start with us.

Our Earth's progress is the sum of the individual progress of all of us.
