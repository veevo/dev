What's the secret never to grow old?

In the longing for eternal youth there are few those who turn to the most
various resources.

Clinical treatments, surgeries, interventions of the most varied, with a
Only goal: try to cheat time.

But he inexorable, seems to be stubborn about not letting himself be deceived.

Soon further, his weight is made on everyone's shoulders, leaving marks
Indelible.

But is it really possible to always stay young?

                                   *   *   *

Whoever saw that lady, with friendly face, easy talk, hair
well-arranged whites, could not imagine the challenges that life gave him
offered.

The daughter of immigrants, she was raised in the community of Ukrainians who arrived in the country,
along with his parents.

You'd learned the language Portuguese after eight years, which had left marks on your
language, loaded with accent, as if foreign were.

He married new, with another immigrant, maintaining ties with the community and
roots, of which he has always prided himself.

With their children, and there were five in all, great challenges came.

Early on, she noticed her husband's tendencies for the game.

Her imbalance got to the point where she had to go out in the dark in the early hours of the morning,
fleeing from creditors, carrying only the children, the clothes of the body, without
Whereabouts.

This addiction followed that of alcoholism, making her husband often
oblivious to the responsibilities and difficulties of the home.

In most of these moments, she saw herself, keeping her family.

Not often, the days dawned without her having what to put in the pan to
children at lunchtime.

He often deprived himself of eating, so they could better feed.

However, he never lost his faith, his joy of living, his optimism.

Never, throughout all existence, has it been allowed to complain about what life has been
Offered.

On the contrary, always good advice, a salutary reflection, a history to
entertain those around her.

Widow, with children raised, others were his ideals.

He regularly returned to the immigrant colony from which he had left, to take
money, food or clothing, which he collected from the closest, to
Distribute.

She crocheted as leisure and, from the result, she used to present herself,
donate, favor so many.

At the age of seventy, he decided to create a radio program on the culture of his
Ancestors.

It was to bring encouragement to the old immigrants, who missed their
country, she justified.

And personally, he sought sponsorship, with those he knew, to finance
your dream.

For more than ten years, until her disincarnation, she took her word friend and
to all who listened to her on her Sunday show.

And so he deceived time.

So he died young, over eighty years old.

He left the lesson that if aging the body is something inevitable, the
aging of the soul and mind is each of us' choice.

Anyone who carries dreams, noble ideals, goals to achieve, not
matter age, will always be young, deceiving time wisely.
