Around each of us there is a psychosphere, formed by fluids
that will be good or bad, according to our mental behavior.

Those who live in an inner climate of imbalance create around themselves a
negative psychosphere. Of course, those who cultivate moral and intellectual virtues
will be involved in a pleasant atmosphere.

But the places also have their peculiar spiritual atmosphere. This will be
formed by the set of ideas, feelings and desires nourished by those there
live, work and move.

To give you an idea of how much spiritual environments affect us make a
Analogy. Imagine a closed room, soaked in cigarette smoke and a
another, well airy, illuminated by the sun and where no one smokes: you certainly get
would feel better in the second environment than in the first.

What happens on the spiritual level is more or less the same thing. But instead
cigarette smoke, which contaminates spiritual fluids are the thoughts
of hatred, of malice, of irony... And what purifies them are feelings
noble, such as tolerance, understanding, patience.

Many people complain that they don't feel good indoors, that's
very serious, especially knowing that the home symbolizes for the human being his
shelter, its protection. There, more than anywhere else, he must
feel good.

So, what to do?

There are no miraculous solutions, even because peace depends on our effort
for gaining inner balance. But there is an absolutely positive habit and
which serves as an antidote against many of the evils that reach us: it is prayer in
Family.

Always on the same day and at the same time, family members gather to read a
uplifting page and comment on it.

The occasion is taken to talk to the Creator through prayer,
thanking you for the existence, asking for protection...

Family prayer is food for the soul and often pain so and
anxieties that fall upon us are the fruit of a kind of malnutrition
Spiritual.

Collaborate with a milder psychosphere in your home, avoiding screams, discussions
empty and senseless fights.

But do more, send, through prayer, an invitation to the Creator of all
things so that He, with His luminous presence, may come to be part of his life.

Prayer in the home, before the shadow of indifference and wickedness that fears in us
involved in these days, is a beacon of light guiding a New Age, the Age of love.

                                   *   *   *

We are imperfect spirits. It's hard to find a person who never
zangue, who does not get hurt from time to time or never think evil.

Hence we realize that our emotional dystonias end up disturbing the
environments, especially our own home.

That's why family prayer is so important. This is the moment when we stop to
meditate, think of life, under the protection of good spirits.

Talk to your family members and try on this light for some time
inside your house.

Think about it, but think about it now!

                                   *   *   *

Wise is the man who leads life knowing where life is taking him.
