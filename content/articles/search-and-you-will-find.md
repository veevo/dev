There is a passage in the Gospel in which Jesus states: Seek and find.

It is interesting to note that consistent activity in seeking presupposes a certain
Effort.

Those looking for something move the resources they have to find it.

Christ's promise is that the one who seeks to think.

Thus, it remains for each one to analyze what their personal search is.

Freedom governs the Universe and each soul decides the path it wants to go.

If the creature is enchanted by worldly illusions, it will eventually live them, in
some measure.

The result varies depending on the means that you are willing to use and the
effort to spend.

Everything has a cost in life, including laziness and inertia.

Who opts for arca comdism with the high price of opportunities
Wasted.

Considering the ephemerality of human life, it is appropriate to reflect well on the
that is elected by goal.

What really pays to get it hard?

Some spend their energies to enrich.

However, the uncertainties of the business world sometimes cause painful
Surprises.

Even if a man succeeds in enriching himself, he cannot take his own fortune to the
Die.

Fatally leave your possessions behind as you return to the homeland
Spiritual.

Thus, while noble and necessary, economic activities do not constitute
the reason for the existence.

Life is triumphant and never ends, but the experience of the physical body does not
lasts more than a few decades.

Precisely for this, everything that binds to matter is only an instrument
for larger achievements.

It is not wise to confuse the means for the purposes, otherwise bitter preparation
surprises for himself.

It is a desatine to compromise one's own dignity in exchange for fleeting jouissance.

Worldly values and successes get in the way.

However, the conscience the Spirit takes with it wherever it goes.

In the flesh or outside it, you can't get rid of yourself.

Aware of this, reflect on your options.

What do you incessantly seek, with what goals you spend your energies?

Within a hundred years, will your current goals have any relevance?

Without olvidating their human responsibilities, it would not be wiser to take care of
their immortal interests?

You will find what to look for, assert the Gospel.

It may be that the salary of your searches are expensive clothes, tours and enjoyments the
more diverse.

In this hypothesis he will return to the spiritual plane as a beggar.

But you can choose to be someone generous and pure habits, an authentic encouragement
for his brothers on the journey.

If you try to pursue your release of vices and mediocrities hard,
will fatally reach this goal.

The result will be a spiritual dignity that will accompany you forever.

Think about it.
