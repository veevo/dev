Jesus' message reveals to the world a loving God full of compassion.

The Master states that all divine law boils down to the act of loving God,
close to himself and himself.

It is concluded that the experience of love frees and pacifys creatures.

Certainly so is instinctive in the human being the desire to love and be loved.

Nothing is more pleasurable than spending a few hours with the people who
speak closely to the heart.

Our most expensive affections, the ones we cultivate most fondly, constitute
consolation in the trials of life.

Providing joy to someone dear causes great delight.

Each one develops and demonstrates affection in the conformity of its understanding and
Possibilities.

Scientist who spends his life seeking to discover the cure of diseases evidences
love of humanity.

Maybe he doesn't have sweet and affable words for his aides.
It may be that the concern in fulfilling your task makes you inattentive to the
expectations of those around him.

But not so is his extreme dedication no longer a valuable demonstration of
Love.

The teacher sincerely dedicated to teaching also exemplifies love.
Perhaps his pupils consider him rigid and preferred someone less demanding.
It is that we more easily identify love with manifestations of tenderness.
The mother who hugs a son seems loving to us.

A father with an educator's posture does not convey this impression of candura.
But it is urgent to recognize that the law of love is not limited to cuddling, smiles and
pieguices.

Our fellow journeys, friends and relatives, are, first of all, children
of God.

It would be our intention to imagine that we have greater capacity to love than
Divinity.

And the heavenly Father, though his infinite love, does not fail to allow the
creatures grow through their own effort and work.

A careful analysis of life reveals that it is in permanent transformation
and improvement.

Animal species, plants, the conformation of the planet earth itself, everything
reflects movement and metamorphosis.

The thermal societies gradually improve their codes and values.
Thus, the law of love includes the need for fraud of beings.

Love for God must hover above all other feelings, for it is the
origin and the support of the universe.

If we love God, and the world he created is in continuous improvement,
we must strive to understand the laws governing it and improve
Also.

Likewise, by expressing love for our fellow fellow, we cannot intend to
steal from the experiences necessary for your advance.

This understanding of life leads us to admit the need to merge our
affection with plots of rationality and discernment.

Love for a child, student or friend does not always imply agreement with your
fantasies and aspirations.

It is often necessary to renounce the immediate joy of pleasing our
loves, for the sake of their progress and their coming happiness.

The mother who refrains from educating the disobedient son demonstrates more tibieza than
What's up, honey.

On the other hand, the master who demands dedication is more precious to students of the
that a teacher relapse.

The exercise of love sometimes requires sacrifices, by countering the most
immediate heart.

This feeling is made of affection and tenderness, but also of firmness and righteousness
of character.

After all, being a sublime energy, love cannot provoke the moral fall of the
be loved.
