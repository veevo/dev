All of us parents love our children and want the best in the world for them.

We have that certainty within us and God knows what we are capable of doing,
to pass, to bear, out of love for our little ones.

But are we communicating this love correctly? Or rather: it will be
that our children feel we love them so much?

Oh, but I always say it!

However, is this form purely verbal, sufficient and the only one that exists?

Let's find that no, and more, that we can love our children, yes, but that
we may not be communicating this feeling appropriately to them.

There are many ways of demonstrating it, and one of them, of supreme importance, is the
Empathy. Empathy communicates love.

Empathy stimulates tender proximity, intimacy and eliminates loneliness.

Just as empathy brings your son closer to you, it brings you closer to him, too.
When we put ourselves in someone else's shoes, when we really got it
capture your point of view, suddenly something happens: the behavior
of this person comes to make sense.

Let's look at a simple but meaningful example:

Karen, a three-year-old girl, gets afraid of the supersonic noise of a
plane and runs crying to his mother.

In the typical reaction, the mother says: Well, my daughter, it's just a supersonic noise
made by an airplane. You don't have to be afraid.

This attempt to reassure the child says, in essence: Do not have this
feeling of fear. There's no need to be afraid of the noise of airplanes.

Evidently, the mother tries to end fear through a logical explanation.
But the very loud noises are really scary for young children,
whatever your cause is.

Logic ends empathy in this case. And Karen doesn't feel understood. The
explanations are more useful after dealing with feelings.

At the moment of strong feelings, the first need is understanding. The
explanations can stay for later.

In the empathic reaction, we have: Karen's mother hugs her daughter and says, My God, was
a noise. It's terrible!

At this brief moment, Karen's mother enters the fearful world of her daughter and
shows that you understand it.

The empathic answer tells Karen: Mom is with me. She knows how I feel.

When the child knows that her fear is understood, she is more able to hear the
logical reason for the cause of fear.

Empathy is listening with the heart and not with your head. If the empathic response is
spoken in cold, neutral tone, the child does not feel understood.

Possibly, we must have already reported an experience to another person, who
answered like this: It is... must have been hard for you...

We know when that saying is true or just for form. When he is
true, we feel understood and there is nothing better than if
feel that way, doesn't it?

We need, as parents, to dive more often into the world of feelings
of our children. Only then will they feel loved. Only then will they go if
feeling overwhelmed.

That's being a life-long companion! That's loving! empathy communicates love.
