There is an ancient Japanese folk tale that tells the story of a bullied girl
by his mother-in-law.

Everything was a reason for her to fight and swear. The young woman was silent, without answering.

One day, a wanderer monk knocked on the door of the house and the daughter-in-law gave him a cupcake
rice.

When she heard, the old lady was furious and told her to get the food of
Time.

Very embarrassed, she obeyed. He sought the man and explained that he would have to
Take the cupcake.

The monk smiled and returned. He also gave her a towel that should be used
to dry the face and soften the weight of living with her husband's mother.

From that day on, the angry woman began to notice that her daughter-in-law was
more and more beautiful. It fueled your anger and envy.

One morning, she saw her wipe her face with her towel and observed that she was more
beautiful and radiant.

He believed it was a magical object and planned to catch it for himself.

The next day, while the young woman went to the market, she stole the gift.

He washed his face and wiped it out once. Nothing happened.

He rubbed his face harder. His appearance began to change.
However, instead of rejuvenating, as he hoped, assumed the appearance of a
Monster.

Horrified, he screamed and fainted.

When the daughter-in-law came home and saw what appeared to be a monstrous creature,
tried to escape. The woman, crying, begged for help.

Recognizing her mother-in-law's voice, she moved.

He left for the village in search of the monk. He would surely know how to reverse
those effects of the towel.

When he finally found him and told him what happened, the wanderer smiled and
Said:

When a person wears the towel, it reveals the appearance of his soul. So that she
go back to as before, just wipe your face with the other side of the fabric.

So it was done and the old lady recovered the previous form.

The interesting thing is that something changed in it after it happened. Stopped
offend her daughter-in-law by altering the way she treats her.

Understood that the monstrous appearance, caused by the towel showed, in
truth, the smallness of his soul. He was ashamed of the cruel way in which
treated his son's wife and struggled to change.

He aged happily, abandoning anger, envy and wickedness.

                                    *  *  *

When we cultivate pride, selfishness, anger, envy, malevolence,
we shape our soul with an ugly, monstrous appearance.

If we apply love, charity, friendship, solidarity, kindness,
we take luminous forms of unparalleled beauty.

It is possible to modify the soul through self-transformation, change of pattern
Vibrating.

This requires courage: to look at yourself, see yourself inside and assume what needs to be
Changed.

Then it is necessary to strengthen the good feelings that we bring in the intimate,
some more developed, others less.

So no matter how old and physical appearance we have, our soul
will take on the unmistakable aspect of people of light conscience.
