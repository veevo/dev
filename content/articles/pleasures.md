Man naturally seeks pleasure and well-being.

It is a reflection of the conservation instinct, whose objective is to ensure physical existence for as long as possible.

Terrena life is indispensable to the intellectual and moral evolution of spirits.

It is only no longer necessary at the upper stages of immortal existence.

Thus, the taste for pleasure meets natural imperatives of evolution.

Sex is pleasurable and through it the species perpetuates itself.

If there was no satisfaction involved in procreative acts, humanity would have long since been extinct.

Food also involves pleasure.

The physical body needs to receive fuels suitable for its structure.

The care of this need is not only due to the appeal of hunger, but also involves satisfaction.

Rest also brings a certain voluptuousness.

The care of all natural needs, whether physical or emotional, encompasses a certain dose of pleasure.

As the human being was not made to live alone, he rejoices in contact with his friends and loves.

The need for contact and recognition by the like, when it is met, produces sweet sensations.

Of course, wisdom lies in balance.

Denying the pleasures common to existence, without any noble purpose, has nothing to praise.

The mother who deprives herself of bread to feed her children shows selflessness and nobility.

But eating less than necessary for maintaining health only for self-flagging is not recommended.

The superior objectives of existence are not incompatible with the small earthly joys.

Jesus signaled this truth by stating that it is not what enters, but what comes out of the mouth of the man who contaminates it.

If the voluntary deprivation of life's property is not good, so does the abuse.

Gluttony causes diseases and decreases lifespan.

The distorted use of genoetic forces produces physical and emotional imbalances.

Sleeping too much or resting too much is a waste of time.

Thus, the relevant thing is to keep balance in the face of terrestrial tastes and pleasures.

If they are not reprehensible, they are also not the goal of existence.

No one is born to eat, drink, sleep and breed.

Understanding pleasure in its real value helps not to demonize or address it.

Living properly does not presuppose abstaining from the joys and satisfactions common to the human condition.

Purity does not lie in the abstention of the gifts of life, but in using them with balance and discernment, without harming oneself and others.

Wisdom lies in everything use sparingly, without becoming a slave to habits, things or sensations.

The purpose of earthly existence is to promote the intellectual and moral evolution of spirits.

All are reborn to overcome ancient vices, to abandon selfishness and live love.

It is not about sentimental pieguism, but the experience of fraternity and compassion.

Do not deviate from this goal by a misunderstood understanding of life.

In the context of his immortal existence, it will be little good for him to become an ascetic.

It will also be unworthy of his condition of immortal Spirit living as an irrational animal, in the incessant search for pleasures.

Strive to be balanced, kind and supportive.

It is very laborious, but it is the goal of his coming to Earth.

Think about it.
