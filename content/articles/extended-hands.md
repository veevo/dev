        As we walk along the narrow walkways of life, we observe, with
weigh, thousands of hands extended towards us.

        They're hands that beg bread to feed the hungry body...

        Hands that ask for affection...

        Hands distended in search of spiritual light, able to beat the
darkness of guilty consciousness...

        Hands that beg the support of other hands, which dry their tears
bittershed by the pain of separation from the dear hands that death
Snatched...

        There are so many hands distended by the alleys of life, which make us feel
powerless, unable to apply for the service of good, before so much
Need...

        However, it is worth seeking, in nature, facts that renew the
and change our way of thinking.

        Copper wire, for example, when dumped on the public road, does not pass
of insignificant object. But, connected to the power of the plant, it is a transmitter of light and
Force.

        The small pipe, abandoned to dust, is stumbling on the road. However, if
adjusted to the reservoir, is a pure water conductor.

        Clay, sleeping in the pond, is simple portion of mud. However
delivered to the care of the potter, becomes a noble vessel.

        The stone, loose in the field, is poor and forgotten pebble. But if united with the
construction, is the foundation of the home.

        The caterpillar, on mulberry, is sad animal of repellent aspect. In
however, taken to the wire industry, produces bright silk.

        The sheep's gut, extended to the sun, is really something despicable.
When transformed into the violin string, it is kind of effective for music to be able to
Arise.

        However, to serve it takes effort and discipline.

        Copper wire, to illuminate, suffers the voltage of electric energy.

        The pipe needs to adjust to be useful. Clay experiences high
fire temperature. The stone accepts anonymity to become supportive.

        The caterpillar must die to aid, and the mutton gut passes through
long renewing process in order to respond safely to the dreams of the
Musician.

                                     * * *

        In fact, we are still fragile hearts, guilty souls, and Spirits
indebted in the face of divine laws.

        But, linked to the Spirit of our Divine Master Jesus, we can be
instruments of eternal good.

        It is not enough, however, to highlight our weaknesses, our lack of
capacity, laziness or false modesty to extend efficient relief in the
direction of the hands extended towards us.

        It is necessary to embrace true humility, with obedience and discipline,
before the Lord's designs, for, by learning and serving; loving and helping;
fighting and suffering in His sublime cause, it will be possible to modify the sad
reality of our planet.

                                   *   *   *

        It is always easy to serve before the blue sky and teach on golden days,
full of tranquility and sun.

        It is up to us to learn to serve under the stormy night, and throughout the
paths full of pain and difficulties of all sorts.
