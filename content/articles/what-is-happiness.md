If we question a group of people about what it means to be happy, we'll get the most diverse answers.

Some will say that being happy means having a comfortable life with no financial concerns. Others will say that the presence of family and friends is enough to bring us happiness.

Others, still, may say that being happy is to find great love, someone with whom they can share moments of joy and those of sadness. And others will say that perfect health is enough for happiness.

Other answers could be enumerated, without being able to state which one is the most correct or the least wrong, because there is no definitive answer.

The Gospel according to Spiritism, in its fifth chapter, presents us the maximum Happiness is not of this world.

Some might think that such a teaching is a barrier to hopes that we all have to find true happiness. However, that is not the purpose of the sentence.

This truth brings light to the great difference that there is between seeking happiness, sometimes utopian and being truly happy.

There are so many who place their hopes of happiness in illusions that money and material possessions can offer.

They spend their lives working to conquer a financial empire and barely realize how slaves are.

Suddenly, when they realize, the children have grown up, their parents have already left, friendships have already broken down and, at that moment, not all accumulated wealth is enough to bring them much dreamed happiness.

They forget that many people are truly happy living in simple homes, with limited financial lives.

Happiness, therefore, cannot be in material goods.

There are others who seek happiness in a great love: When I find that special person, I will be happy, they say.

But how many people have a mate or companion next door and aren't happy? And how many more are there that even if they are single, they always have a joy in their eyes?

So happiness can't be in the other.

So where to find happiness? How to be happy?

The maxim of the Gospel teaches us that true happiness is an achievement of the Spirit, for we have all been created for eternal happiness.

Everything we need to be happy is in our hearts.

If today you decide to be happy, there is nothing that can stop you except yourself.

So don't let it go tomorrow: play, smile, value simple things. Follow the growth of your children, embrace, shake hands with those who want you well.

Do not keep sorrows and leave in the past any feeling of guilt. Don't give yourself to self-pity.

Be optimistic. Vibrate with achievements. Value the present. Plan for the future.

Get organized. Take some time for the family. Take time for social works.

And remember, there is no path to happiness. Happiness is the way.
