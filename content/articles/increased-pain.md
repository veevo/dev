What's the biggest pain?

Have you thought about it?

A young man left a note to family members shortly before committing suicide, and
expressed on paper what he was feeling.

He said the greatest pain in life is not dying, but being ignored.

It's losing someone who loved us and who stopped caring about us. It's being
put aside by those who supported us so much and found that this is the result
of our negligence.

The greatest pain in life is not dying, but being forgotten. It's running out of a compliment
after a great achievement.

It's not having a friend calling just to say hello. It's seeing indifference in a face
when we open our hearts.

What really hurts in life is seeing those who were our friends, always very
busy when we need someone to comfort us and help us get back on their feet
our spirit.

That's when it seems that in afflictions we are alone with our sorrows.
A lot of pain affects us, but this may seem lighter when someone gives us
Attention.

It is quite possible that this young man had his reasons for writing what
Wrote. However, at no time should he have thought of those around him.

If you could feel the pain of a mother's heart torn apart before the lifeless body
of the beloved son...

If you could experience the suffering of a father who tries, in vain, to know the
dead son which led him to unfit size...

If you felt the despair of a brother seeking an answer on the immovable lips of the
be that he shared his childhood...

If i could bear, even for a moment, the pain of a sincere friend to
contemplate his lips emudeted in the coffin, would surely change his concept
about the greatest pain.

*   *   *

If you think you're going through the greatest pain anyone can experience,
consider the following:

A mother crying over the body of the beloved son who was targeted by the bombs
murderers in the name of the cold and cruel wars.

A child leaning over the inert body of the mother hit by grenades
Deadly.

An orphan of war who is forced to wield the same weapons that annihilated
your parents...

A family father who watches the murder of his own, with his hands tied.

Anyway, think about these other pains a little bit...

Think a little of the many hearts that suffer more bitter pain than yours.

And if you're still sure that your pain is greater, remember that
mother who one day watched the crucifixion of the innocent Son, unable to do anything.

Remember also the One who endured the cross of martyrdom but did not lose the
trust in the Father, who knows everything.

And if you still think you're the greatest of sufferers, consider that maybe
selfishness is harming your vision.

Think about it!

Finding out what the biggest pain is, it's very difficult.

But the biggest disappointment is easy to deduce.

It is that of those who commit suicide thinking that they will extinguish life and with it all
Problems.

They come out of the body, but undoubtedly they don't leave life, let alone
end the problems.

Carrying, as difficult as the situation is, it is never worth seeking this
fake door, called suicide.

It is important to always remember: no matter how darkand long the night, the sun
always shines again.

And as much as we think we are in solitude, we always have with us a faithful friend and
dedicated that never abandons us: the sweet Rabbi of Galilee.

Think about it!
