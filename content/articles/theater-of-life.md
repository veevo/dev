Life on Earth can be compared to an immense theater, and people, in their
different experiences, great actors.

On this colorful stage and full of emotions, sometimes we bump into very
beautiful and full of charm; sometimes we come across heads crowned to squander
his pride.

Now with the wise observer, with the fool indifferent and even, with the ugly to
sneaking; now we see ourselves in front of playful clowns and figures
charismatic to present themselves as they may fit.

At the end of the play we experienced, we end up realizing that we all share the
same garments.

When the applause ceases, both one and the other, we share the same dressing room.

We are all the real actors of the dramas represented on the big stage.

The theater of life does not have much rehearsal time for its presentation.

Each of which comes with its previously planned role, and can facilitate or
complicate during the representation.

There are actors who, having received simple roles, end up dedicating themselves so much that
steal the scene, leaving marks that serve as an example for others.

Others ask for great performances, but discouragement and laziness make them
deserving the desired post, having to wait for new programming.

                                   *   *   *

So it happens to each of us human beings in this world.

Our stage is the Earth, the play in which we act, the present reincarnation, our
stage mates, our family members.

If within the same scene the actors do not perform well in relation to the
friendship, respect and positive participation of all, the scene smoky, and
the real sense of the act ceases to exist.

Our audience is humanity, with its preferences, its standards and its
preconceitos.

If we do not have respect for differences, with a loving attention to
too much, we will not have acceptance and success.

We all dress up in the carnal body and share the same dressing room as the experiences
Common.

We all crave the applause of success, but not all of us strive for the
enough to earn them.

Similarly, we missed opportunities and waited for new chances to
redo, to start over.

Let us be therefore the thirsty soul of good performance, which will be reassured after noble
without requiring the main roles.

Let us bless the weariness of every day, without choosing sophisticated bed, but that
we can rest on any bench of the way, making it a castle of
Peace.

Blessed be the sweat of hard work, the pain of the callejada hands that show
of valuable occupation, which does not allow us the empty mind.

Let us keep constructive silence to profanity without content.

We value the laughter that embellishes the sober face of a life enriched with love.

Welcome the many questions towards wisdom, the many searches for
opportunities, which will make us more enlightened and realized.

Blessed are the declarations of love and friendship that color our
Paths.
