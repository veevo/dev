Who was This Man? Descended from the stars and nestled in the boon of a young woman
woman in order to come to light.

Had by father a carpenter and with him learned the craft, though His hands already
had shaped celestial substances, forming the very planet on which it came
Inhabit.

Accustomed to heavenly harmony, he let the wind sing melodies in His
hairdresser and may the sands swipe his face.

He loved His mother with devotion. Soon begun His messianate, returned home to
see her and accompanied her to the wedding she had been invited to.

He obeyed his request and offered the comma the special liquid for the
awakening to reality.

In agony, he recalled giving it to the care of an idealistic young man,
worrying about what might happen to him after His departure.

Who was This Man? Walked through dusty roads, cultivated fields,
shores of a lake, teaching love.

He lived in a time of dismembered, customs corruption, licentiousness.

However, he remained healthy, though moving between people
considered misconduct.

He extended His blessings to the poor disinherited from luck as much as to the
holders of economic power and certain social supremacy, to each other
offering from His lights.

Leader of a group that elected to take on the precious mission of continuing
to His proposal, encouraged them to let their qualities flow
Interior.

You are gods! He said. And you can do everything I do and more.

He taught that all men are heirs to the infinite universe, immeasurable.
All the children of the same Father, though living under various ceilings, in lands
distant from each other and speaking strange languages.

Who was This Man whom the Spirits obeyed and surrendered? Lord of
Spirits - They called him.

Who was This Man who caused the pain to cease, returned movements to bodies
paralyzed, the sight of the blind and the word to the mutes?

Who was This Man who, in less than three years, revolutionized the world of
thought without anything to have written? Who gathered around Him, no less than five
hundreds of workers to continue His legacy?

Who, on leaving, left so much sowing that to this day, more than
Two thousand years, hasn't it run out yet?

Who was This Man so great that it did not fit in history, dividing it between
before and after Him?

They said he was the son of a carpenter named Joseph and a woman
chamada Maria.

Born in Bethlehem, he lived in exile in Egypt. Then he grew up in Nazareth and died in the
religious capital of the time, Jerusalem. Land of prophets.

Who was This Man?

                                   *   *   *

One day, a ray of light left the vastness of the heavens and came to live among men.

Brighter than the sun, hid His brilliance in the plots of the simplest
Carpenter.

He was light. He came into the shadows and the shadows tried to soak his glow.

They destroyed the amphora where the light was nesting. Then, free, she shone yet
more intensely and to this day fills the infinity of our needs.

Your name is... Jesus.
