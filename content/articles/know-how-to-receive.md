Some people have a great ability to give, to offer others
varied gifts. Ability to find out what the other needs and
provide, promptly.

But, it is perceived, that some of us have difficulty receiving what is us
Offered. Sometimes, in certain circumstances of our lives, we react to
certain gifts, with almost intolerance: I hate charity unrelated to me.

We forget that Christ himself, the only perfect Being who has passed through the
Earth, did not shy away from accepting the help of a Simon, from the bands of Cirene,
in Africa, to lead the very logger of crucifixion.

Sure, as in all the acts of His life, he took advantage of the opportunity to
teach the wisdom of receiving. He had so much of Himself, whole love that he was.

But in that circumstance, exhausted by the loss of blood after the torment of the
whips and the crown of thorns, the night insleep, the lack of food and
water, thanked with the look for the assistance of The Cireneu.

And he kept walking to the place of the torment.

He also expressed gratitude at Veronica's gift that, breaking the cord
of isolation of the soldiers, comes to Him and wipes his bloodied face and
sweating: left printed His image on the target linen.

We remember ed a teacher who was sent teaching at a school of
Outskirts.

There, there was a lack of everything. The classroom was dark, unpainted, looking
almost gloomy. The conditions were as adverse as possible.

And the students were children of homeless men and women, without a job, and had to
themselves a derogatory image.

She came in and made a difference. He summoned her husband, friends, acquaintances,
parents themselves and organized task forces. Got paint and the school gained colors
Festive.

He planted flowers to cheer the entrance. And a vegetable garden, for the benefit of students,
that everything received between surprise and hesitation.

No one had ever presented them so much. They were used to having something
none, heading from one to another band, following the uncertain steps of their
Parents.

And now there was a teacher offering them beauty, art, comfort,
affection in all his attitudes.

The greatest joy was on the day she, having received her first salary,
acquired several books and made them available, setting up a small library, in the
classroom.

Textbooks, storybooks, colorful books, full of prints.
Books that filled the eyes and the mind! Those children truly the
devoured, leafing through each as an invaluable treasure.

Their joy filled the teacher's heart with happiness.

The biggest surprise, however, was when their gifts began to arrive:
a flower harvested on the road, on the way to school; a drawing, a card, a
phrase scribbled on small piece of paper.

It was your turn to receive. And he did so, admirably, by redoubling himself into
care for them.

And he kept each of those pampering, emotional, thinking, My God, they have nothing
and offer me gifts.

The wisdom of receiving. Receive gratitude, a hug, a handshake, a
envelope with a certain amount that we so much need, an unexpected gift.

Let us think about it and welcome with joy what friends, acquaintances are offered,
unknown, someone who felt touched by our action, for our lives,
for our difficulty.
