Peter, Elizabeth and Joseph were gathered all afternoon, involved in the work
college, which had cost them weeks of research.

Tired, they couldn't wait to finish and deliver the task.

Elizabeth made the last touches when her colleagues had a controversy.
She recommended calm for everything to end well, but the boys changed in
Too much.

In a moment of irritability, Peter, as he got up from his chair he bumped into the
table, dropping ink over the work booklet almost ready.

The weather has become too tense. Exchange of accusations, despair because,
after all, the deadline was short to redo everything.

Following, there was crying, swearing, altered voices.

They'd have to negotiate with the teacher more time to redo the job.

Elizabeth said she would accompany them, but that the burden of speaking would be of the two
caused the accident.

What a situation they had created!

                                   *   *   *

Irritation, which we suddenly manifest, is a factor of frequent
Conflicts.

Causing adrenaline discharges into the bloodstream, it alters our
organic balance and, above all, the emotional balance.

Often, tiredness is responsible for this crisis.

This enemy manifests itself in the form of impatience and makes us unkind and
Rough.

The harsh expression produces equal reaction in those who receive it and hit back with discharge
mental anger of revolt and dislike.

The first attitude we should have, when we perceive in us manifestations of
constant irritation, is to examine his origin.

And if the fact is repeated and reprises, it is advisable to seek specialized help
before we lose expensive friendships to our hearts or hurt those who love us.

Knowing our emotions will always make us realize what we need to change in
We.

Keep in mind that irritability is thorn spiked in the flesh of emotion,
that must be excised.

The more it remains, the worse the state of those who lead it, generating infections
lasting and pernicious.

If we are an irritable person, we easily demonstrate our bad mood and
Dissatisfaction. That's because we bring these seeds into intimacy, in quality
of aggressive and bitter feelings.

Our conduct becomes intractable and we come to be known as those who
we ruin the environment in which we find ourselves.

We become people of hard to treat, feeling happy when we displease
to the other; when we see others in trouble.

With such provisions, of course we will create an aura of dislike to the
around us, driving away people, who will decline from our company, in
any circumstances.

Let us therefore keep in mind that true happiness does not cause pain or
Suffering.

That sick feelings spend more energy to manifest than
those clothed with true love.

That we have freedom of choice for our options, but we will have to respond
by all the choices made.

That it is much easier and more rewarding to opt for the feeling that
will lead to happy coexistence.

As only love has the function of uniting, with possible brevity, we have trained
humility and prayer.

Humility will strengthen our intimate peace and prayer will give us the strength to
overcome cruel weakness.

Let's follow our walk, pacified, leaving irritability simply
as an experience in our past.
