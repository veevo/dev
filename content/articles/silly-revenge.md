Chinese legends are very interesting and always full of teachings.

One of them tells that King Sol had a much loved daughter, so beautiful that even
even the Yellow Emperor was full of admiration for her.

As King Sun left to direct the course of dawn, every morning, the daughter
wished to go with him.

But he was very busy and couldn't take her with him. One day, she reined
secretly behind his father, on a boat.

Unfortunately, a storm rose and she was engulfed by the sea, leaving
his father taken with sadness.

However, she was reborn as a striped-headed bird, red claws and
white beak.

Because of your sorry singing is called Jingwei.

For Jingwei promised to take revenge from the sea, saying he would turn him into land
Dry.

Therefore, he began to pick up small stones, with his beak, flying from his house to
the East Sea and dropping them on the irregular waves.

The sea said to him: Little bird, give up! Even if you work for a million
years, you will never turn me into a desert plain.

Jingwei's spiteful response was: Even if I take ten million years or
hundred million years, by the end of the world, I'll try to make you land
Dry.

Jingwei's descending females continue in the endless task of seeking
pebbles and sticks to land the sea.

                                   *   *   *

The Chinese greatly respect this bird for its railway determination and
by the willpower.

Monuments were erected in their honor and can still be seen in several
on the shores of China's east coast.

Sung in verses, the legend became synonymous with invincible idealism and
hard commitment.

We allow ourselves to focus on another facet of this bird: the hatred it distills. Hate that
consumes you the days in useless revenge.

Knowing, though, that you will never be able to achieve the goal, you say you will die
Trying.

Sometimes isn't that exactly how we behave? Hit in our pride
or what we say is our honor, we focus our energies on foolish
Revenge.

Even if everything we do does does not reach the target, which we consider our enemy,
we didn't give up.

Even when the organism, recording our negative vibrations, signals
alarming diseases, we persist in the intention.

We suffer, we cry but ratify: Morro, but I do not give! I'm going all the way!

Is it worth it? Is it no longer productive to adhere to the forgiveness taught by Jesus?

Deep connoisseur of human psyche, exemplary therapist, He recommended us
reconciliation with the adversary.

He knew that nothing positive brings revenge, harming, first and
above all, to his promoter.

Let us think about it and let them go in peace who attacks us or poisons us the days.

For our part, we vibrate in good, for good and enjoy health and happiness.
