Dealing with the act of giving, so wrote Gibran Khalil Gibran:

Then a rich man said to the prophet, "Tell us about the gift!"

And he said:

"You do little when you take your possessions.

That's when you're given yourselves that you really do.

Yes, what are your possessions but things you keep for fear of needing
of them tomorrow?

And tomorrow, that will bring tomorrow to the ultraprudent dog that buries bones in the sand
quickas you follow the pilgrims to the holy city?

There are those who give little of their much, and do so to be praised, and
his secret desire devalues his gifts.

And there are those who have little and give it entirely.

These trust in life and generosity of life, and their coffers never
Empty.

And there are those who give with joy, and that joy is your reward.

And there are those who give without feeling sorry or seeking joy and without thinking about virtue.

They give how, in the valley, the flower spreads its fragrance in space.

Through the hands of such people, God speaks; and through his eyes, He smiles at
the world.

It is beautiful to give when requested; is more beautiful, however, give without being requested, for
only understood.

And for the generous, seeking who receives is a greater joy even if that of
To give.

And is there anything you can keep?

All you own will be a given day.

Give now, therefore, that the time of gift may be yours and not your
Heirs.

And you who receive - and you all receive - do not assume any burden of
gratitude so that you do not put a yoke upon you and your benefactors.

Before, stand, together with them, upon wings made of their gifts.

Because if you become too worried about your debts, you will be
doubting the generosity of the one who has the liberal land by mother and God by
Father.

You say many times: I would give, but only to those who deserve it.

The trees of your orchards don't talk like that, nor do the herds of your pastures.

They can continue to live, for retaining is perishing.

Certainly, who is worthy to receive their days and their nights is worthy to receive
of you everything else.

And those who deserved to drink from the ocean of life deserve to fill their glass in your little
Stream.

And what greater merit there will be than the one who resides in courage and trust,
even more, in the charity to receive?

And who are you so that men should expose their intimate and bare their
pride so that you may see his naked merit and his self-esteem
Demoted?

Try to see first if you deserve to be donors and gift instruments.

For, in fact, it is the life that gives life, while you, who judge yourselves
donors, you are simple witnesses."
