According to higher spirituality, the groups of terrena life constitute
evidence or atonements.

The atonements stem from mistakes made.

Because he possesses a certain vice, the Spirit violated divine law.

For example, as a result of gluttony, it impaired the harmony of his body in
previous existence.

He lived less than he should and stopped fulfilling his spiritual programming.

Atonement represents the sum of pain necessary for the Spirit to dislike
of the addiction that affects him.

It originates from the error, but aims at progress.

Persistuntil the lesson is learned and the lackof the singing of his moral fissure
and repent.

It is a strong remedy in exact measure of evil to be fought.

The tests are literally tests to which being submits to achieve
more sublime experiences.

While proven always involves effort and sacrifice, it is something
Positive.

Raciocine is based on the entrance exam for access to colleges.

Students sign up, pay a fee for it, study for a long time, and,
finally, undergo the exam.

Of course, in the time when they are demonstrating their knowledge,
remain under tension.

But the entrance exam represents a phase necessary for them to achieve their goal.

This is the gateway to a situation they dream of.

If they succeed in the entrance exam, they can take the chosen course and, more
afternoon, to play the desired profession.

Surely none of them feel wronged in the hours that come to carry out
their examinations.

They applied and that event has a serious purpose in their lives.

The same is true of the evidence of material life.

Before reincarnating, the Spirits choose the tests to which they will submit.

They prepare for a long time, study, take wise resolutions.

They have the help and instruction of more evolved beings, to whom they promise
commitment to overcome the natural obstacles of the journey.

After rebirth, the evidence slowly presents itself to the one who
applied to experience them.

For those who wish to consolidate the virtue of patience, such evidence comes in the figure
difficult people with whom they have to live with.

What aims to exercise frugality and humility is reborn in a context
very humble social.

There are those who propose to experience diseases, those who want to exercise the
tolerance or detachment.

For each, the experiences arise in due course.

It is well seen that no one should complain about anything on Earth.

Atonements are a remedy for old moral evils, which only bring
Disorders.

The evidence represents an opportunity for the consolidation of virtues, with a view to
to a better future.

The role of those who live them is to do their best and trust God.

Think about it.
