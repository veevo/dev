It is narrated that a sage walked with his disciples along a tortuous road,
when they found a pious man who, kneeling, begged God that the
help get your car out of the quagmire.

Everyone looked at the devotee, became sensitized and proceeded.

A few miles ahead, there was another man who also had the
car jammed in a slime. This, however, braved complaining, but tried with
every effort to release the vehicle.

Moved, the wise man proposed to the disciples to help him.

They gathered all their forces and managed to remove the transport from the quagmire. After
thanks, the traveler himself was happy.

The surprised apprentices asked the master: Lord, the first man prayed,
he was pious and we didn't help him. This one, who was rebellious and even cursed, received
our support. Why is that?

Without disturbing himself, the noble teacher replied: He who prayed, awaited that
God would come to do the task that was competing for him. The other, though desperate for
ignorance, committed itself, deserving aid.

Many of us usually act as the first traveler. In the face of
difficulties, which seem insoluble to us, we settle down, hoping that God
do the part that is up to us to solve the problem.

We can and must make efforts to improve the situation in which we
Found.

There are people who wish to see obstacles taken from the path by hand
invisible, forgotten that these obstacles, for the most part, were there
placed by ourselves, and it is now up to us to remove them.

Some drop into the soslow, claiming that the situation is difficult and
that there's no point in fighting.

Others do not have perseverance, abandoning the fight after slight efforts.

With property affirms the popular wisdom that stone rolling does not create slime,
suggesting change of route, movement, dynamism, realization.

It is not enough to ask God for help, it is necessary to seek, according to the teaching of Jesus:
Search and find, knock and open up to you.

We must therefore do our part that God will help us in what is not
within our reach to solve.

*   *   *

         It would be ideal that, without complaining and thinking correctly, we would
efforts to remove from the quagmire the car from our existence in order to
move on happily, with courage and disposition. Confident that God
will sustain our strength so that we may triumph.

Let's think about it!
