Have you ever realized that there are people who require us a little more effort to
be loved?

While some have easy access to our hearts, giving us joy and
pleasure in sharing the conviviality, others ask us for personal commitment to
few moments of relationship.

We find them in the workplace, in the family, in the neighborhood or
in the most diverse social relations.

They bring values that are not compatible with ours, have attitudes that
displease, use language that seems inappropriate to us.

His concepts seem absurd to us, his somewhat sdrúxulo way of life, and
their moral parameters shock us.

These are the ones that require us to strive for us to love them.

Because they still walk away from the roads we elect to ourselves, the
coexistence with many of them seems to us a great sacrifice.

However, when Jesus teaches us that we must love our enemies, it is these
master refers to.

We often imagine that enemy is only the one for which we nurture
hatred, desire for revenge, deep grudge.

It's true that these are. However, these others, those who have not yet been able to
love and want well, represent the same invitation that life makes us to
we learn to love.

It is true that, from breaking, we will not be able to have them as friends, receiving them
in the intimacy of our home.

It won't be in a few days that we'll have sheltered them in our hearts.

And it will not even occur overnight the transformation of our feeling, of a
intense antagonism for unrestricted sympathy.

However, as we understand The Teaching of Jesus, we are able to
devote something more than our dislike, to those that seem to us stones of
Stumble on the journey.

Thus, as we seek to understand its limitation, tolerance begins to
share space where before there was only implication.

When we can perceive their intimate dramas, impatience loses place to
indulgence.

When we know a little of their life stories, their dramas and
difficulties, the harsh words are being replaced by silence, when
not for words of support.

Thus, in the exercise of sound approach, understanding of others, that the
love begins its journey.

Initially it is done in the form of some virtues, which are devoted daughters to him,
benevolence, indulgence, forgiveness.

Gradually it is gaining form, allowing a more healthy coexistence and
Enriching.

Finally, to the extent that we allow, the feeling will turn into empathy
and understanding.

Therefore, in these difficult relationships that present themselves in our ways,
let us realize the great invitation that life makes us to exercise love for
Next.

Even though i still know that a long walk awaits us until we learn,
effectively, to love them, it will be in the small steps of today that we will conquer
this love for these difficult to love.

Let's exercise love.
