afarnaum was a small town that was situated on the northern side of lake
Genesaré.

Their valleys were fresh, cut by cantantes streams.

On its beaches the waters were good for fishing and, for this reason, disputed
fishermen.

The housewas low, surrounded by leafy trees, colored by vines
of fine flowers.

Jesus loved that city and chose it for the beginning of His ministry of love.

He ran from mouth to ear the news of the healings and the wonderful deeds of the Master
Nazarene, attracting curious and distressed from the surroundings.

Simon Peter's house had been invaded by a large number of people who
they sought Jesus.

The sun was high, when a group, carrying a paralytic, tried
approaching the door.

The crowd was so compact that it was not possible.

However, such was the affliction of the sick, long attached to the bed, that his
friends lifted him to the terrace and descended him down the ceiling of the room where the
Rabi.

A small space has opened in the crowded room, and the Master, without demonstrating
any surprise, looked to the sick.

Natanael ben Elias, do you think I can cure you? " Jesus asked, looking at him
in the eyes.

Yes, I do. "He answered quickly.

Taken sudden ly trembling, he asked:

Sir! How do you know my name? Do you know me?

Yes, I've known you forever. "Jesus answered. " I am the good Shepherd who
he knows all the sheep the Father has entrusted to me.

Even before Nathaniel could reflect on those words, Jesus
reached out on him and said to him with a firm and imperious voice:

Get up, take your bed and go to your house.

Nathaniel stood up and gave a cry of euphoria as he perceived himself free from the disease
who congratulated him for a long time.

Without much delay he left Peter's house, in the company of his companions,
still without understanding what had happened to him well.

At night, when Jesus sought redoing on the lakeside of Genesaré, Peter the
found with his eyes immersed in tears.

Rabbi, are you crying? Of happiness, I suppose, after so many events
Happy...

I cry, but with sadness. " Said the Master.

I cry, Simon, because at this moment, many of those I healed today meet
delivered to old vices. They regained the mood, the voice, the health, to
precipitate again in the crashes of folly.

It will not be long before they are entangled in new imbalances, harming
painfully their own existences.

Meanwhile, not far from there, Natanael ben Elias commented on his healing, with
childish joy, among drunken friends and unhappy women.

Just as the Master described, Nathaniel, like so many others, without valuing
the new chance he had received, was indulging in misunderstanding and addiction.

                                   *   *   *

Christ's proposal never intended to offer man joys
Superficial.

The pains that come to us - usually caused by our own negligence -
are harsh methods, however, effective to heal and discipline our Spirits
repeat offenders in the error.

Only the effective understanding and application of the teachings of the Nazarene Master
will enable us to achieve true happiness.
