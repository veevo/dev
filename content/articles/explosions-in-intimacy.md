In the hustle and bustle of today, creatures overwhelm and distress,
depression and despair are allowed.

The headlines that come from overseas are no less uncomfortable than those that
we've got it around here.

If it comes to unemployment, the news comes from all continents. If it is the
violence, they hatch from the entire globe. If it is the devaluation of life, the facts
Generalize.

Some think it's the end of time, prophesied in the Apocalypse. Other
think it is the total decay of the human race.

All this is troubling, we can't deny it. And there is no doubt that threats
bombs and explosions spread terror and fear.

However, this is the time to meditate maturely and observe more
clear the situation, starting with our own intimacy.

Concerned with external circumstances, we do not realize that
darkest bombs and the most destructive explosions are the ones that take place in the
daily life, when man becomes a jackal of man himself.

Bombs of indifference are dropped and explosions of coldness arise that bury the
noble initiatives, petrifying the best feelings that spring up in the soul.

Vanity bombs are mounted and explosions of sorrows appear, capable of poffing
hearts, destroying the generous sources of life.

They rinse the operating pumps of those other people, providing conditions for the
explosions of misery and lack, disarticulating progress.

Bombs of inominable hatred, generating explosions of revolt and
rebellion, damaging fraternity trials and dismantling understandings
happy, for fostering the virulence of cruel vengeance.

They etrondeem bombs of malevolence and intrigue, checking out explosions of
aggression and violence that lead the individual to imbalance and madness.

Malquerença pumps are installed with explosions of intolerance and irritation,
pest generators that sick entangles the intimate weavings of the soul.

Bombs of pride and greed, lust and lascivious are forged, articulating explosions
demeaning character, poison the process of socio-moral life of the
individuals who miss excellent opportunities to well drive their own
Lives.

Thus thinking, we will conclude that all bewildering action that individuality
imposes on its social circuit, will become a portion of war,
destruction, of negativism, added to the mental waves characterized by the
disturbance, feeding darkness everywhere.

                                   *   *   *

More than ever, modern man needs to identify with God in order to
to serenase their intimate world, of educating yourself ethically and morally, exercising
understanding and respect for himself and his fellow, following decided in the
light climbing.

It is imperative that we build a world glorified by peace and love that so much
we aim, beginning in the provinces of one's own soul, seeking our encounter and
identification with the Spirit of Christ.

Let's think about it.
