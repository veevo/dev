The death penalty may at first be intended to legally punish a
offence and deter further transgressions to the law. We say at first why it seems
be settling in some countries where there is, another purpose. The
Revenge.

It is that in some American states is allowing the victim's relatives or
victims, watch the execution of the criminal.

In the comments of some of them, you feel the taste of revenge: It was smooth
Too.

We are not one of those who claim that one must have for criminals the same
posture you have with good men?

Of course, they need to have curtailed their freedom. To receive a
Reeducation. To work in some way to remedy the damage caused by
for their criminal acts.

So, for example, it would be very fair for those who would reap a parent's life or
of a family mother, worked to ensure orphaned children the

Whoever took the life of a child, i risk their parents, who would support them from then on.

Whoever destroyed the public or domestic heritage, which returned, did not
importing the number of years, in the form of compensation, the well destroyed.

That would be very fair.

However, if someone dies by lethal injection or by any other
form, will it be valid?

We can assess how much hurt, pain, goes into the hearts of those who have been
raped doors inside the home and saw their affections killed, so
cynical and cold.

However, what will the killers be worth dying? It will bring back the loves
Murdered? Will you remedy the violence perpetrated? You will be able to erase the trauma of the
dread of a kidnapping? I'm sure you don't.

Once upon a time, as long as we continue to cry out for revenge, it will not change
the panorama of the world. Thoughts and actions need to be modified.

Rigor in justice. But justice. Justice that translates opportunity for reeducation.
Renewal. Or we will be one of those who believe that once a criminal, always

If God thought about us like that, we wouldn't have the opportunities

That's not to mention that Christ's morals prescribe forgiveness. Who more than

The most humiliating of them: crucifixion, penalty imposed on the rebels,
criminals considered enemies of Rome.

He was slapped, spat on his face, manipulated him, undressed and O
Plagued. Before he was killed. Humiliated.

And he was innocent...

However, no word of revenge. Let yourself be driven. What to do when the
madness dominates?

But before handing the Father the Spirit, pray: Father, forgive them. They don't
they know what they're doing.

It is the exact measure of the righteous who knows that only ignorance commanding the
Spirits generates violent and murderous sanha.

Did you know that?

... what to deal with victims of violence is increasingly difficult? According to the
doctors because guns are increasingly powerful and accurate.

It wouldn't be very good for us all to make a great task force and instead of
we perfect weapons to kill and mutilate, we strive to architect
plans to deflate hunger, illiteracy and misery?
