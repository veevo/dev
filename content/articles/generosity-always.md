Are we generous in the face of life?

Maybe that question will take us by surprise. Maybe we never thought of that.
Or, who knows, is something we believe you don't have to worry about.

But surely at some point, we were presented with the generosity of
someone who crossed our path.

Generosity is this sense of detachment from oneself.

That's when we forget our needs, our problems and occupations
to deal with others.

Generosity is such expensive currency, treasure so precious, that it can only be
pays equally.

Thus, generosity do not reciprocate with the recognition of a thank you very much.
Nor can it be paid with gifts or monetary values.

Even less we can repay the generosity offered to us with a
simple favor or some kindness.

Only with generosity is paid for the generosity we receive.

By being born in noble hearts, fruit and daughter of selflessness, it is a high currency
Carat.

Therefore, it is normal that those less noble, who do not yet have any
generosity in the heart, be wary of generous attitudes.

They judge the selfless attitude of the other as permeated by ulterior motives, as
who wants something beyond the action itself.

They come to be embarrassed when they are the target of the generosity of others, for in being
for this gift, they feel affected by pride, presumption and
Vanity.

Almost always, we forget that it is also generosity when we are able to
recognize in the action of the other his kindness, his noble attitude.

That's when we can perceive this invisible, discreet, movement of the
generosity unrelated to us, who we have become grateful, recognized to
who in this way toasts us.

In this way, the writer, who achieving a grand prize, remembers
to report it to the teacher who alfabetized him, to the mother who led him, to the father who
formed his character.

The boss, the business leader who, in the face of a great achievement, is generous
professional, is able to divide it with employees and employees,
sharing laurels, knowing only representative of a large team,
recognizing that alone would not reach such a level.

Generous we are when we share happiness with those who meet
crossing hardships, food with whom it suffers hunger, our time with the
solitary, our smile with those who are plunged into deep sorrow.

Antithesis of selfishness, generosity is a flower of rare perfume that, when being
distributed, always keeps the hands of the one who offers it.

Generous was the Samaritan of the Christian parable, as he forgotten his
commitments, offering your time, your care and your currency resources
to meet the wounded lying on the side of the way.

And yet, worrying about the future days, committing to continuity
aid.

Generous were Mother Teresa of Calcutta, Francisco Cândido Xavier, Gandhi,
Albert Schweitzer and so many others who have forgotten about you in order to perfume the
lives of those around him.
