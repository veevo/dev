When someone asks us about our stature, we soon inform you how tall we are.

But if anyone asks us about our spiritual stature, what do we say?

Maybe you never thought of it, but spiritual stature is our real
Dimension.

The remarkable Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa wrote, in one of his poetry:
Because I'm the size of what I see and not the size of my height...

I'm the size of what I see, here are the parameters to know our real
Stature.

How do you look at the world? How do you act in your sphere of influence? As
do you deal with the issues of the universe in which you move?

Answers to these questions help to scale your spiritual stature. If
you look at the world from a comprehensive point of view that contemplates more than
your own home, your job, your family and your friends, has a good
Stature.

If, in your sphere of influence, you always and unconditionally prioritize the
the nobility of the initiatives, the importance of each person involved in the
context, you're great.

If in the decisions that fit you you always take into account the effort, the dedication,
the intentionality of those who present a project, a new idea, a
suggestion, you have a great stature.

It is about the same consideration and respect for all people, if not
discriminates against anyone if it doesn't pre-judgments and always acts fairly, you're
Giant.

But... if their world comes down in their own interests and those of their
of their football team, your political party, your religion...

If you reject new projects that are presented to you, suggestions or opinions
that come from people you don't estimate, or pose some risk to your
personal interests...

It acts according to your conveniences, that of your coreligionists,
who think like you, so you have spiritual stature of pygmy.

There are people who can't glimpse the true values of life,
because his spiritual stature is minimal.

These are the people who feel jealous, jealous, and can't stand to see others
Happy.

Because of their spiritual myopia, do not admit the good performed by a
individual who cheers for the opposing team, professes a faith different from his or her
has divergent ideas.

Even if they work in the same corporation, they profess the same faith, or be of the
even political party, these pygmies do not accept good ideas, simply
because they're not yours.

That's a very limited view, and that's why we live in a world yet
ethically-morally.

When our horizons expand, and our vision is much greater than the
our height, then we will form a nation where happiness can make an address.

*   *   *

People who have a comprehensive view of life are the ones who do good for good, and
not for convenience or shady interests.

They value the good initiatives themselves, not the people involved.

The general good becomes the goal, and whoever wishes to join forces to
accomplish it will be welcome, as a true brother.

And now, do you know how to answer what your real stature is?

Remember that you are the size of what you see and not the size of your height...
