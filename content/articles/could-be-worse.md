The day had only dawned and Jorge was already halfway to the company in which
Worked.

The slow steps and the ground-facing gaze demonstrated the sadness and
discouraged that he was possessed.

He entered the workplace a few minutes before the schedule and greeted the
colleague, somewhat discouraged.

Upon realizing Jorge's sadness, the companion asked him, interested:

What happened to you? Your gaze denounces bitter feelings...

That's true. I bring on my shoulders the weight of hopelessness...

All about me are just misfortunes and more misfortunes... I feel powerless, and
I think I'm the most unhappy man on the face of the earth.

But, after all, what happened? - You've infiltrated your colleague.

Now, my younger brother contracted great debt and ran away without leaving the address.
My brother-in-law got involved with robbers and is behind bars.

The companion who listened attentively, observed: But it could be worse...

Jorge continued:

My wife, frivolously, became involved with a much younger boy than her, and
abandoned the home...

But it could be worse... - Retorted his colleague.

My best friend betrayed me, spreading slander about me...

However, it could be worse... - Spoke again the companion.

Jorge could no longer bear to hear that statement and asked, somewhat angry:

Well, I've told you so many misfortunes and you just know how to say it could be
Worse? What could happen that was worse?

The friend answered serenely:

You said your brother took a loan and didn't honor the commitment...
That your brother-in-law got involved in robberies... That your wife betrayed you... What yours
best friend slandered him... And I can safely state that it could be
worse, if you were the author of so many unsatines...

Jorge, somewhat shocked, looked at his colleague at length and answered half
Reluctant:

Right... could even be worse...

Sometimes we come across situations that make us sad because we feel the
heart torn apart by betrayal, slander or misunderstandings of the
Dear.

However, if we have already been able to remain faithful to our own conscience,
we can offer support to those who are still struggling in the turbulent waters of
moral vices.

                                   *   *   *

Even though the razor of ingratitude delaces our hearts...

Although the misfortune of loved beings compresses our affectionate heart...

Even if we have to sorify the cup of slander, let us remember the greatest example of
Jesus, in the face of the betrayal of his friend who had lived with Him for almost three years...

Let us remember the tears of sublime Galileo before the suffering of others...

And finally, let us remember the last sentence you uttered from the top of the cross
infamante: Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do.
