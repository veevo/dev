Our father, who is in heaven, on earth, in fire, in water and in the air.
that you are in the flowers, in the corner of birds, in the heart to pulsate; that you're in the
compassion, charity, patience and the gesture of forgiveness.

Our father, who is in me, who are in the one i love, in the one who hurts me,
in the one who seeks the truth. Our father, who is in the one who walks with me and
in the one who has already left, leaving my soul injured by longing.

Sanctified be Your name for all that is beautiful, good, fair and graceful, for
harmony of Creation. Be sanctified by my life, by the
opportunities so many, for what I am, I have and feel and for leading myself to
Perfection.

May Your kingdom of peace and justice, faith and charity come to us, light and love. Kingdom that
I am summoned to build through meekness of spirit, a reflection of the greatness
interior.

Your will be done, even though my rogatory values my pride more
than my real needs.

Although I often do not understand more than silence in response to
my prayers, not hearing you like saying, Son waits, thy is all
Eternity.

Our daily bread gives me today and i can share it with my brother. The
material conditions that sometimes have nothing good if I don't remember who lives
in affliction.

Body bread, soul bread, bread that is life, truth and light. Bread coming to bring
encouragement and joy: it is the Gospel of Jesus.

Forgive my offenses, my mistakes, my faults. Forgive when you
makes my heart cold; when I allow evil to be externalized in the form of
Aggression.

That, more than talking, I can hear. That, instead of judging, I seek
Welcome. That, not cultivating violence, I sow peace. That, saying no to the
demands too much, may you all thank.

Forgive me, just as I forgive those who offend me, even when my
heart is wounded by the bitterness and displeasures of ingratitude.

May I, Lord of Life, remember that no sorrow is eternal and that the
only path that makes me sublime is the humble road of reconciliation.

Do not let me fall into the temptations of errors, vices and selfishness, which make me
slave of my malevolence.

First, may Your light be upon me, enlightening me, so That I may find you
within minh'soul, as part of my essence.

And it delivers me from all evil, from all violence, of all misfortune, of all
Illness. It delivers me from all the pain, all the sorrow and all the disappointment.

But still, when such difficulties are necessary, that I have
strength and courage to say, Thank you, Father, for more of this lesson!

                                   *  *   *

All that surrounds us is Divine poetry. There is a trait of God in every being of
Creation.

Let us seek for Him in the blossoming of flowers, in the run of the waters, in the corner of the
wind, in the flicker of the stars.

But above that, let's look for Him inside. It is enough that, by a
let us close our eyes and feel Him: there He is, giving rhyme to the verses of
our lives...
