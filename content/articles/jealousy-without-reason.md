As I left the laundry in the proper place, I stumbled into my sister's diary
thirteen years old.

I soon thought, "What do I do now?

I've always been jealous of my little sister. Your charming smile, your
captivating personality and many other talents threatened my place as daughter
principal.

I competed with her quietly and saw her skills grow.

As a result, we rarely spoke. I was looking for opportunities for
criticize her and overcome her deeds.

Now your diary was at my feet. I didn't think about the consequences. No
took into account your privacy, the morality of my actions, nor your
Feelings.

I just savored the chance to find enough secrets to foul the
reputation of my competitor.

I reasoned that it would be my duty, as the older sister, to check your
Activities.

I took the book from the floor and opened it. I flipped through the pages, looking for my name,
convinced that she would discover plots and slander.

When I found it, the blood froze on my face. It was worse than I suspected.

I felt weak and sat on the floor. There was no conspiracy, no
Defamation.

There was a succinct description of herself, of her goals and of her dreams,
followed by a short summary of the person who inspired her the most. I started to
Cry.

I was your hero. I admired myself for my personality, my accomplishments, and,
ironically, by my integrity.

I wanted to be like me. He had watched me for years, quiet, marveling at
my choices and actions. I stopped reading, struck by the crime that had
Committed.

I had lost so much energy to keep her out of my way...

Now, I had violated your trust.

Reading the serious words my sister had written, seemed to melt a
icy barrier in my heart and I wished to meet her for real.

I could finally put aside the stupid insecurity that kept me away
hers for so long.

That afternoon, when I managed to support myself on my own legs, I decided to go
up to her.

But this time, to meet instead of judging, to embrace rather than fight.
To live as true sisters.

Sometimes we've been acting like children, with respect to the people around us.

We imagine they don't like us, who desire our unhappiness, our downfall.

It is important not to establish pre-judgments in any situation, however much
facts conspire in favor.

It will not always be possible to discover others' feelings for appearances.

There are people who cannot express their feelings and give an impression of
coldness or indifference.

That's why pretrial is highly damaging.

Therefore, if we need to imagine the feelings of others, let us
efforts to always imagine the best.

Jealousy produces the cancer of suspicion, transforming the dreams of his hope
into a cruel nightmare, which becomes a time-consuming illness, to erode it
Inside.

Think about it!
