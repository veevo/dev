 They were young, kind and friendly. His countenances radiated joy.
They loved each other with that first love that resembles a flowering tree that
waits for the propitious station to turn into a fruit barn.

They came together for love. He was a modest employee and she seamstress. They turned around and
They loved themselves. They loved and came together.

As they came together, they soon thought of the blessing of a first child. The girl, looking
cherubim engravings, asked God to give him a son as beautiful as a
of those angelic figures.

A year has passed. The loving pair joined savings and prepared what is necessary to
dress a newborn.

She sewed cambraia robes with precious lace, white ensembles with
Fine embroidery, hats, everything more beautiful and delicate to receive your baby.

They waited for the son who imagined beautiful and who should come asking for kisses with
their smiles.

Anyway, the time has come for childbirth. Golden felt the first pains and after
a laborious period gave birth to a boy.

Soon i wanted to see him, but her husband and the people who surrounded her simply to
they looked sadly.

Among themselves exchanged melancholy looks and whispered something she could not
Understand.

Finally, after insisting, Aurea ended up screaming, Don't you listen to me?
I want to hug my son. Are you dead by any chance?

No, they told him. It's just... The boy has no arms, no legs!

Aurea extended her own arms and answered with anxiety:

Well bring him in, if he has no arms, no legs, he'll be in my more time.
Arms.

The boy was beautiful. Blue, expressive eyes, very abundant blond hair.
His parents loved him. But the father, when his wife could not hear, said with
deep bitterness:

I wanted a son so badly. And he came without arms or legs. What a great
injustice committed God to me. If only I was rich, but I'm so
Poor!

                                   *   *   *

In the face of such a painful picture, the Spiritist Doctrine offers us deep
elucidations, through the law of rebirths, of the thesis of the multiple
existences, of the Law of Cause and Effect.

It allows us to open a door to our yesterday, our past, within the
History of Earthly Humanity.

In The Book of Spirits, spiritual messengers clarify the great
the issue of suffering, pain, illness, stating that they are not factors
proposed by the Creator, but consequences of violations of His Laws.

Thus, according to the nature of the faults committed by the Spirit, he himself
choose the evidence you want to suffer.

Evidence that leads him to the atonement of the faults committed and to progress faster.

God, in His righteousness, allows the culprit to return to the scenario where he delinquiu,
for rectification of your errors.

And as Jesus taught: If your eye is cause of scandal, tear it out and throw it
outside, today's shortcomings and mutilations portray exactly the quality of
yesterday's unsures.

But, as God is justice and also mercy, it allows debtor souls
with loving hearts that accept them and help them with devotion, in their
trajectory of rescues and pains.

That's why it's common to find mothers carrying children who don't walk without
regret the effort they make.

Mothers who live with children of ears and closed lips and who nevertheless
speak to the acoustics of the soul, telling them of their love.

Mothers who receive disabled children of every order and who dedicate themselves to them,
anonymous heroines, with detachment and love.
