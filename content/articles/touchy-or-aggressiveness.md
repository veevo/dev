Melindre has several definitions. Can be defined as kindness, delicacy
I don't try, modesty, modesty.

However, it is almost certain that when used by people, the concept that
is easy to get hurt, of offending, susceptibility.

In this sense, its invocation in human relations has been common. The smallest
attitudes of an employee, a friend receive immediate adjecactivation.

Therefore, friendships are diluted, disagreements happen, doubling sorrows of
one and the other side.

In the various facets of voluntary work, touchhas been used to
justify defecations, betrayals, misfits and moral breach of contracts of
Volunteering.

That he exists, it's true. But that people sometimes give themselves a higher value
of what they truly possess and await special treatment, it is also
Truth.

However, another side of the issue presents itself and has been forgotten, almost
All the time.

If touchy is the manifestation of wounded pride, no less true than medra,
among creatures, much lack of touch, delicacy and kindness.

In the name of a false charity, to express the truth, friends and companions of
work allow themselves to throw to the other's faces everything they think.

And they don't measure words in your expressions. It's like they're taking stones and
played mercilessly.

And what they expect is for the other to accept everything. When the assaulted man rises, when
takes an attitude, when talking about respect, is taken as the one who
melindra.

However, at no time did the aggressor, the one who was impolite and ferocious,
I am sorry. No, he's right. The other is that it carries a lot of pride.

In this tuning fork, honorable working lives have literally been played in the
Garbage. Birthday servers have had their efforts depreciated, as if they were
something at all.

And what criticizes evilly, what points out the minimal mistakes is the hero, the person
Correct.

Let's redo the steps while it's time. Before we destroy affective values
Precious. Before we attack centuries-old institutions with irreproachable sheet
dedication and service to the community.

Let's look at how many times the guilt is up to us. How many times have we been
causeers of the removal of people from our life.

Or the institution to which we provide service. From our family, from our sphere of
Friendships.

We recall that, once, at a working meeting, a volunteer interrupted
aggressively the speech of the coordinator.

He complained and complained, hurting and humiliating him in front of others.

The wounded man shut up, sore. After a few days, he sought the aggressor in
Particular. Alone with him expressed his sorrow, with the sincere goal of
modify wounded emotion and appease your intimate world.

The interlocutor, instead of recognizing the indelicacy, reversed the situation and gave
the merciless diagnosis: there had been no aggression on your part. The other is that
melindrara.

Let's think about it. Does the almost daily finding of touchland in others not
has become an escape valve for us?

An excuse for our daily rispiity, our relaxation in dealing with
the similar one?

                                     * * *

Who melindra should work to become less susceptible.

But whoever provokes the touchman cannot forget the law of charity, the
affability and sweetness advocated by Jesus: Blessed are the meek and
Peaceful.
