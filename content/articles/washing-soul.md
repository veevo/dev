That morning, on her way to work, Marcela heard a conversation on the bus: I
I told her everything that was stuck in my throat. I had no compassion.

And how did she react?

He was crying, apologizing, but I didn't forgive him. I washed my soul.

Marcela remembered a fight she had with her sister a few years ago. And of
as he had said harsh and heavy words.

When confronted by her grandmother, she had said that same phrase she had just heard:
I washed my soul!

Remember that grandma had asked what it meant to wash the soul.

Well, it's putting out everything that bothers you.

I understand. " I had spoken to the wise lady. Then your heart must have been at peace
after you've said such hard things. The anger passed and you and your sister stayed
Well, right?

Actually, no. I'm still hurt and we're still brigades. But I said it all
what was stuck.

It means you washed your soul, but you didn't forgive.

I didn't forgive, I didn't forget.

So you didn't wash the soul, my girl. When we wash something, like an outfit,
for example, we took all the dirt from it. When we propose to wash the soul is
to take everything that harms us from her: anger, grudge, sorrow, pride, selfishness.

And we only get that when we understand each other, when we can't
we feel affected by the poorly received and forgive.

Marcela had had a shock to hear those words. I've never thought of the
term washing the soul from that perspective.

                                   *   *   *

There's a very old idea that says we should react, counter offenses, pay
in the same coin. That's still remnant of the eye for an eye, tooth by tooth,
practiced in the times of Moses.

Master Jesus, however, taught, "You have heard what was said: an eye for an eye and
tooth by tooth. I, however, tell you that you cannot resist evil; but if someone
to hurt you on the right face, offer him the other one too.

In this exhortation lies the key to understanding and practicing forgiveness.

What moves us to fight back an offense is usually our wounded pride. No
we can see that those who often offends are sick,
in need of help.

As we return the injury, we feed bad feelings and energies in both
Sides.

Forgiving an offense requires courage and integrity, still misunderstood by the
that we let ourselves be dragged by pride and selfishness.

A washed soul is a soul free of negative feelings.

But... how does the soul clean sey?

The secret lies in loving others as ourselves. See who hurts us in a
brother lacking in love as much as we do.

Washing the soul of negative feelings implies the greatest act of courage of all,
that's failing to put ourselves first to understand what's
provoking the attitude of the other.

It is to do for him what we would like them to do to us, when also in the
we feel hurt and hurt.

It's understanding and helping.
