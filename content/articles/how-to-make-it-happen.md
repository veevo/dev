Some time ago we received, with joy, a small pamphlet, produced by a
school supplies company, entitled How to make it happen.

In it we find a list of tips, from very safe guidance to
succeed in the endeaves of our lives.

Under the subtitle of Paths for an effective make happen, we read the following:

First: view, in detail, as if everything was already accomplished -
imagine in detail the desired state. This crystal clear image is something that will
of course guide you as to what should be done, how to get started etc.

Second: quickly take the first step – trust the flashes you have.
If you feel inner confidence, act without hesitation and take the first step. The
nature will make the sequence happen.

Third, do everything body and soul – don't be "warm," "doing it".
Even the impossible becomes possible when we get fully involved.

Fourth: do everything with good will and pleasure – the probability of working
increases tremendously when we do everything with a cheerful mind.

Fifth: be optimistic – don't let yourself be influenced by cynics and
Pessimistic. Help build the ideal every day taking the step of the day.

Sixth: Focus on your strengths – rather than letting yourself be blocked by
possible weaknesses, anchor yourself in what you have best.

Seventh: concentrate energy – avoid wasting it by doing things in half,
or starting many projects with nothing to complete.

Eighth: be natural – don't be defeated by "over-effort." Do the
that has to be done and maintain inner tranquility. Give space and time
for nature also do its part.

Ninth: be transparent – don't even think dishonestly, as it drains your
Energy. Have you ever wondered how much energy we spend to "protect" the lie
counted yesterday? Being transparent makes energy multiply.

Tenth: be generous – "generosity moves mountains." Things flow better
around him because generosity makes him act. Picuinhas, on the contrary, immobilize
people.

Eleventh: always act fairly, that is, avoid the posture of taking
advantage of everything. Act thinking about benefits for everyone. Things start to
happen more fluidly.

Twelfth step: trust 100% in your inner strength – making it happen requires
faith, especially in itself. It is this conviction that lets him loose to make the
that is necessary.

Finally, thirteenth: seek excellence, always – a make happen
must be anchored in the search for the best, the perfect, the ideal. Time
that we will take to achieve perfection is something else. The target, however, should always
be perfection.

                                   *   *   *

Accommodation can become a dangerous addiction in our lives.

We use the word vice, because if we allow it, it dominates us, in the
dominating, until it is part of our natural state of being.

What begins today with a little laziness, with a little discouragement, can
gain greater proportions and launch us to processes of depression and sadness.

Thus, let us remain attentive to any indication of these feelings that are not
welcome, and soon we dust them away from us.
