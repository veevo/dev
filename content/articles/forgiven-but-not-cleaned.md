In our faults, most of the time we are immediately forgiven, but not
Clean.

We are forgiven by the fel of malevolence.

But the shadow we cast on the road of others remains within us for
agony of embarrassment.

We are forgiven by the embers of slander.

However, the fire we throw into the head of the next one sets us on fire to the
Heart.

We got the pardon for the serious offense we made.

However, the stone thrown at the walking brother returns, for sure, the
strike us our own being.

We're forgiven for the surveillance failure.

But the damage to our neighbors covers us with shame.

We were given forgiveness for the manifestation of weakness.

But the disaster we cause is moral pain that follows us the days.

We are forgiven by all those whom we hurt, in the delirium of violence.

However, wherever we are, we must extinguish the monsters of remorse that the
our thoughts articulate, beesless.

The chaga we open in someone's soul can be light and renewal in that same
Someone.

He understands, forgives and rises.

However, this same scourge of affliction follows grief in our lives.

Injury to the like is mental scourge that whips us.

The snake carries with it the poison it carries.

The scorpion holds in itself the poisonous load it secretes.

We can be ridiculed, attacked, persecuted or torn apart.

But let's avoid evil, even when he assumes the defense feature.

Because all the harm we do to others is bad for ourselves.

In the context of life majeure, no one hurts without getting hurt.

Almost always, those who have gone through the blows of our thought already in the
Forgave.

With this proceeding, they were filled with peace and moved on.

Blessed by the forgiveness they have given shine on the higher planes of the
Existence.

However, by the law of correspondence, we ruminate, indefinitely, the
sinister frames that we create ourselves.

Every consciousness lives and progresses between its own reflexes.

Purity, kindness, and forgiveness are rewards in themselves.

Betrayal, cruelty and slander are always a problem of those who elect them to themselves
because every consciousness brings in itself your paradise or hell.

As a result, on the spiritual level, until it is redimted, it is very sad to
situation of those who became guilty.

With awakened and vibrant consciousness, it feels in the constant presence of its
victims and this constitutes a cruel torment to him.

To avoid living something similar, just elect the good as a standard of conduct.

Think about it.
