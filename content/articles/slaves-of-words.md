Have you ever realized how much we become slaves to the words we speak? From
how do we lead through difficult situations by our own speech?

Thoughts, while kept in the intimacy of the mental home, are
property uniquely and exclusively of those who idealize them.

However, the thought that becomes a spoken verb becomes of dominion
public and we must respond to their reflections.

The word that builds, ennobles, helps, is a treasure that we dispense with the
Walk.

However, the acid verb of destructive criticism, maledicent comment seeking
the demoralization of those of the other, or the unfair accusation of the foolish trial, are
difficulties we have encountered and of which we will have to account, one by one.

So it's an attitude of wisdom to keep an eye on the words that come out of our mouths.
Thinking before speaking is a sensible attitude that saves us from many sorrows.

To this end, it is imperative to cultivate the reflection and self-analysis of what is happening in
our intimate world, for the mouth speaks of what is full of the heart,
as Jesus warns us.

Some researchers even claim that circulate in our mental home about
of 95,000 ideas per day, of which 85,000 are repetitive, sick,
monothematic.

For the verb to be constructive, it is necessary to exercise cleaning
mental mind, so that from the mind we can externalize what does not enslave us
Negatively.

The exercise of inner silence, of isolating a few moments daily from the
world to meet with itself is fundamental.

As we dive into the silence of our mental home, we get to know and understand
which intimate world we carry and which, often, still shows itself
totally unknown to ourselves.

Let us keep an eye on our words, so that they may be useful, profitable and uplifting.
Let us avoid the evil comment, the hasty trial or the wrongcharge.

Still, let us preserve our talk of pimp expressions, comparisons
grotesques or vulgar jokes. The emotional and psychic climate, with which we
we involve, it is the fruit of what we think and what we talk about.

If the mind still brings difficulties, if unhappy thoughts still take
our mental home, often disturbing us, let us do inner silence,
letting those thoughts slowly give way to others, more
noble and enriching.

We have cultivated the elegant verb, the word of consolation, the uplifting themes for
that our mouth is not who condemns us, making us slaves to what, of
invigilant way, we express with the word not reflected.
