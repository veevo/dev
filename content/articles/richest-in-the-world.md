It is common to hear stories involving illustrious people from our present day.

Not always true. Some very positive but that, after a survey,
reveal totally unfounded.

We then chose to narrate the fact, of excellent lesson, without pointing out the eventual
Involved.

It is said that one of the richest men today, when asked about
of someone who overcame him in fortune, would have responded with the following
Narrative.

When I was not yet famous, certain done, at new york airport, I saw a
newspaper salesman.

I wanted to buy a copy, but I found out I didn't have enough coins.
I returned the copy to the newsman, I thanked him, saying that I lacked money
to pay.

The salesman insisted i take the paper anyway. "I am
giving," he said, firmly.

After about two or three months, at the same airport, the fact happened again.
Likewise, the boy offered me the newspaper, without me having enough
coins to pay you.

I refused, but he said, "You can take it. I share this of my earnings. No
I'll be losing."

And there I went with my copy again.

Time has passed. Almost twenty years later, famous and known in the world, I remembered
that seller. Would you still be at the airport in the same role?

I looked for him, and I found him after all. I asked him if he knew who I was.

"Of course i do, " he said soon. "Who doesn't know?" And i said my name.

I then asked, "Do you remember you gave me the paper for free?"

"Yes, I remember, and it was twice."

"So," I told him, "I want to pay the help you gave me back then. The
what would you like to have? Whatever you want, I'll give it to you.

"Well, " said the man, "you really believe you can match my
Help? You see, when I gave you the papers, I was a poor salesman.

You now, very rich, wish you give me something. Do you think your donation can be
match mine?"

And concluded the interviewee: That day, I realized that the newspaper salesman was
richer than me because he didn't expect to become rich to help someone.

                                   *   *   *

If we think, in a hasty way, we can qualify the newspaper seller
as someone proud.

However, we need to extract the lesson, just as we teach the
Gospel.

Observing donations in the temple, Jesus says that the two small coins
deposited by the widow were a much more significant donation than the
countless coins left by the rich Pharisees.

The point is the creature depriving itself of something to offer to the other, which crosses
a necessity.

In essence, this person is the potentially rich because rich is his heart,
who thinks of the similar, before in herself.

After all, when we give what we have left, what we don't need,
of course has its merit, because it denotes our detachment, our will
auxiliary.

However, the most excellent donation is that creature that gives you than you can
miss. It breaks down the bread you have to satiate your own hunger.

It offers water to placate someone's thirst although they are also thirsty.

That's the truly rich one.
