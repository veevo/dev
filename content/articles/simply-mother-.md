God, in His Creation, made in infinity, a beautiful garden. Through the Universe launched
seeds of love. Sun to sun, light to light, one by one, one at a time.

Throughout the garden we find the Creator. In everything, the divine signature. Close the
eyes, feel and believe, look.

In the Universe, everything is movement, dynamics, balance, perfection. There's no question
unanswered, there is no effect without cause, conquest without work, merit without
Donation.

The seeds were cast, scattered through which the view does not reach. There is no
death, there is no end. In every death, a fresh start. At every end, a hope.

Attentive eyes will find the most beautiful flower in the garden of the Omnipotent. For her,
various adjectives: tenderness, life, affection, love, devotion. Or mother, simply
.

Sir, I pray to you for all the mothers.

In every gesture of love You reveal yourself and, even more I find you, O Father, in love
mother, for I know that motherhood is one of Your faces.

Mothers, sir. Mothers who are an example of giving, of sacrifice, selflessness,
generosity, of faith.

I pray you, Father, for the mothers who, for nine months, carried in their wombs the
sprouts of love and which, for life, continue to guide them in the footsteps, the
forgive them for weaknesses and offer them the restorative embrace.

I also ask for adoptive mothers, who love with detachment and lack of interest the
son of other mothers. And for those who had their children missing,
never recovered and thus lost part of their own hearts.

I beg you, God of forgiveness, for the presidiary mothers, who cannot be together
suffering the acute pain of longing.

And for those who have their children in prison and who, hopeful, deposit in them
trust, waiting to return to the good path they have pointed to them.

For sick mothers, alayers, hospitalized. That the good Spirits,
fulfilling of Your will, strengthen their spirits and pour upon them the
balm of Thy comfort, mercy, and peace.

I also pray for the abandoned mothers. Those who, in old age, were left in
asylums, shedding the bitter tears of loneliness.

And for grandparents, aunts, madrasts who, for love, transform grandchildren, nephews,
stepchildren, in children of the heart.

Yet, Lord of eternity, I pray you for the disincarnated mothers, these
true angels of the guard, who continue to watch over their own, for they understand
that motherhood is not merely a biological phenomenon and, yes, an eternal bond of
Souls.

Jesus' sweet mother, in the simple manger, You have welcomed him into Your arms. Your
heart, in silence, beat in the rhythm of Him and Thously: it was Your son,
son of God, too.

You welcome, mother par excellence, all the mothers of the world in Your love. Makes the heart
of them manger for Christ Jesus, so that He may be born in the Spirit of
every child of our ground.
