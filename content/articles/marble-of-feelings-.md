It is said that, in the first days of the year thirty, after some time of meditation
in the Judean desert, Jesus was seen in Jerusalem near the temple.

Sitting, like a pilgrim, the Rabbi was noticed by a group of priests, who
were attracted by His traces of beautiful originality and His
lucid and deep look.

Some of them soon walked away, but Hanan, who would later be the judge
inclement of His cause, approached the unknown and proudly said:

Galileo, what are you doing in town?

I pass through Jerusalem, seeking the foundation of the kingdom of God! Exclaimed Christ,
with modest nobility.

Kingdom of God? " He made the priest with a sharp irony. And what do you think it is
Right?

This kingdom is the divine work in the hearts of men! " Jesus clarified, with
great serenity.

Divine work in your hands? "He fought Back Hanan, with a laugh of contempt. And
continued with several ironic observations.

You propose to perform a divine work. As a matter of fact, have you ever seen a statue
perfect modeled on mud fragments?

Priest , jesus replied to him, with serene energy – no marble exists more
pure and more forous than that of feeling, and no chisel is superior to that of the
sincere goodwill.

The priest still struggled between one and the other vain aside, but it was over
pulling out angry, squealing.

The moment passed, the priest passed... The lesson, however, remained
Immortalized. Jesus made it clear from the first preaching, what was the
kingdom that he wished to build.

He was the experienced sculptor who had subjected himself to being born among us, the
apprentices of the hands, willing to show us the way to saverour our
souls themselves, our greatest works.

It was the teacher and, at the same time, the beautiful statue, carved, made perfect
through the ages, through the law of progress.

Man feeling was still the rough, hard block, waiting for the best chisel
to start revealing to you the beautiful image you carry inside.

This instrument would be goodwill, which the Master would use to carve and in the
would show you how to use this powerful tool for our own
Improvement.

Within goodwill is work, dedication, persistence and time.
Making the soul beautiful is craft not just for a lifetime.

                                   *   *   *

The marble of feeling and the chisel of goodwill – let us remember that.

Millennial sculptors we are, apprentices of the great craftsman who was Jesus,
we are here to develop good feelings.

The inferior feelings, those that still make us suffer so much, these will
falling to the ground naturally, like the remains of the marble that the chisel will
Removing.

Goodwill for us, patience, persistence and seriousness in the task are
Fundamental.

Goodwill towards others, benevolence, indulgence and forgiveness, complete
our precious tooling to build this important work.

We are our greatest work. Let's think about it.
