Open the box of a puzzle for the first time, of these thousands of
tiny pieces, it's like coming across a great challenge of life.

At first, it seems impossible. The parts are very similar. Some
of them, we are able to swear, are identical in color, shape and fitting.

How to find every piece of a blue sky of the landscape, if all are the same? For
that this play would go here and not there? How to distinguish each green piece from a
great kills if they all have such similar color nuances?

Some despair: This is not for me! What am I doing here? –
Say.

There are those who just give up.

Others stand there, looking for a few minutes, astonished...

Where to start?

If we have patience and a little perseverance, we observe the image of the box. The
painting, the beautiful landscape that of that confusion may come out one day, who knows...

And she seems to tell us, "It's worth a try! It will be rewarding!

We look at the box, we look at the pieces. And we're looking at it.

So an interesting phenomenon begins to happen. As we focus on
one point of the image, our brain goes through a magazine through the pieces, a
detailed magazine.

Then those little sinhas that seemed to be all the same, of the same color, begin to
show a little distinct. They have small details that differentiate them from
of the others. Even the colors are not the same.

In blue we find different shades and in that and that and there is a small stain on the
tip we hadn't seen before.

Everything happens depending on the focus. We are focused, attentive, dedicated.

We will never be able to solve problems and overcome challenges without focus, without attention.

Right now, the anxious chest calms down. Breathing changes. The vision seems to stay
more powerful. We're seeing things we didn't see before!

Our performance improves. We've seen some form. There are fifteen, twenty pieces
together that encourage us to continue, until a terrible moment comes: the search for
by a specific piece that does not seem to be on the table.

It is a fundamental piece, important to finish that phase, or an area
determined, and we did not find her.

All to...

We're not able to conclude again.

                                   *   *   *

So it also happens with complex problems.

In that case, we have two paths to go. The first is to take a break,
change our thoughts, go out, air the mind, talk about other things.
Take time.

The second is to ask for help. After all, who said we have to solve our
problems alone?

There's no shame in that. It's no sign of weakness. In the example that we serve,
Putting together a puzzle in someone's company is much more fun.

We will see that we will soon be on the way again and that a help is always very
Welcome.

Finally, facing the challenges ahead, going through the problems and passing
well we will realize that we come out stronger, more mature, as well as who
finishes the assembly of a puzzle.

And we will take with us the lesson of concentration, perseverance, tranquility,
success achieved, due to the difficulty overcome.
