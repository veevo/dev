Nowadays one can perceive the inglorious struggle fought by ethical values
against the selfish interests of citizens.

Unfortunately this problem will only be solved when education takes this
Responsibility.

Perhaps without reflecting much on this, parents are the first to give
examples of violation of ethical principles that should guide the actions of the
good man.

A very critical point is the issue of copyright.

Piracy of CDs, videos, ideas and other products is frightening.

The acquisition of parts in stolen car dismantling workshops, even
knowing this, because it costs cheaper, or other merchandise produced by
illicit means, are also ways of feeding this aggression to the principles of
Ethics.

Generally the individual who commits this fault claims that he cannot be
responsible for it, for it was not he who stole the car, nor did the
illegal copies.

In this regard, Allan Kardec proposed to the Superior Spirits the following
Question:

He who does not do evil, but who takes advantage of the evil practiced by others,
Is it as guilty as this?

The Benefactors responded:

It's like i've been practicing it. Taking advantage of evil is participating in it. Maybe not
able to practice it; but since, finding it done, it takes advantage of it,
is that approves it; would have practiced it, if i could, or dare.

Nowadays it is very common if you throw the blame on the Internet, as it is alleged that the
lack of laws proper to this end and anonymity favor this type of
crime.

However, common sense says that the Internet only shows the ethical problem
however, does not create it.

If the rogue internet user likes a message he finds disclosed in some
website, it copies it and starts to disclose it as if it were yours or as being authored
Unknown.

But if the internet user is honest he will pass the message preserving the credits
to whom right.

As can be seen, the problem is not in the media, but of the
Individual.

Both individuals are someone's children, they were someone's students, lived
with someone who was responsible for his education.

When the child breathes ethical values in his home, hardly the
despise scorn as a young or adult.

But if you don't get these notions of honor in childhood, you will rarely respect them
Later.

So it's worth thinking a little bit about these issues so important and so
Serious.

And if there are doubts as to whether an action is right or wrong, as to whether it is a
good or evil, just follow the guidance of the greatest Master the earth has known and
do to others what I would like others to do to him.

That is, put yourself in place of the one to whom the action is addressed and ask yourself if
I'd like to be in your shoes.

If the answer is positive, one can act without the slightest concern, but if it is
will certainly bring displeasure, even if the action escapes the laws of the
Men.

All of us, without exception, will answer for our acts before the
court of one's own conscience and we will receive according to our works. And
this we've known for over two millennia.

So if you want to have a clear conscience, do not accumulate debris
morals, for they disturb and congratulate him, in this world or in the beyond-grave.

*   *   *

If you want to have your rights respected, respect the rights of others.

Do to others only what i would like others to do to you.

And to ensure the happiness of your children, pass on to them the moral heritage of the
honesty and honor, always considering that life does not end in the tomb,
and that our actions will follow with us as silent witnesses,
applauding us or disapproving us.

Think about it, but think about it now!
