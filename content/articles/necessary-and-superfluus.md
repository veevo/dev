When man approaches the Gospel there are many questions that
Do. Sometimes conscience tells you that you must take certain attitudes and open
hand of others.

At certain times, the message seems to establish conflicts with the reality that
Lives.

This is, for example, with regard to what is necessary or
Superfluous. What will be the exact point at which one ends and the other begins?

Will traveling be superfluous? Will having multiple shoes and clothes be wrong?
Allowing yourself to leisure and spending some money on it will be superfluous?

We remember Mother Teresa of Calcutta. When invited to receive the Award
Nobel to which she lived jus, she asked permission to dispense with the banquet, for
preferred that the importance to which he would be spent on him be given to the
his poor.

He then stated that two spoons of rice were sufficient for his
Power.

To get dressed, two sarís was what he had.

To his mind, it was quite clear what was necessary to him and what he considered
Superfluous.

Let us, however, agree that we need to present ourselves in accordance with the
functions and the profession we exercise.

Depending on the profession, it will not be superfluous to maintain a reasonable wardrobe,
to allow us to attend the places in the proper clothing, if this is
Necessary.

Superfluous will be the vain ostentation of costumes and brands.

We feed is necessary and each of us has its quota established by the
his own body. He tells us the limit of what is necessary.

When we distort our eating needs, allowing us to gluttony,
we create artificial needs and fall into the superfluous.

Perhaps a good measure of the necessary and superfluous can be given to us by the
our wardrobe. When the clothes are so many that the closet no longer
can store when when we open your doors fall several pieces, because that
there is no more room to fix them, here's the superfluous.

When mold and moths took hold of our guard, they are saying that
superfluous because if the need dictated the use, footwear, handbags, clothing does not
would remain long enough in drawers and cabinets to serve as a
to moths and suffer the continued action of moisture.

The boundary between what is necessary and the superfluous has nothing absolute.

Everything is relative and it is up to reason to put every thing in its place.

Let us develop in us the moral sense and sense of charity that allow us to
the hit, sharing what's left with those who have little or nothing.

 You knew...

 ... that man's pursuit of well-being is a natural desire?

And that the search for well-being is only undue if it is conquered at the expense of
someone or collaborate to weaken the physical or moral forces of the
Man?

The greatest merit for man is to do good to others.
