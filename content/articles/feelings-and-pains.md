Increasingly, the resources of medicine, its research and achievements come in the
bringing benefits and facilities.

Yesterday's pains find palliatives previously non-existent and the incurable
once, today it is treatable.

Thus, thanks to scientists and researchers, difficulties and pains,
ills and diseases that afflict our body have been minimized when not
Extinct.

However, there is another type of pain that these treatments and research, even new
medicines and analgesics cannot be carried out.

It is the pains that are born in the soul, and that, of course, there remain, waiting for
your healing process.

Although using us from a physical body, we are, in essence, beings
Spiritual.

Thus, it is natural that some afflictions and difficulties are appropriate of the
soul, for it is the thirst and origin of our emotions, which only has in the body
physical externalization, but not its matrix.

Sorrow, disillusionment, anger, intolerance and so many others are feelings-pains,
that arise in our souls, inviting us to repair and healing.

Causing dystonias in the intimacy of our emotional world, as long as they are not
consistent with our divine essence, generate states of serious disturbances if
untreated and excised of the soul.

So every time any of these feelings-pains lodge in our soul, it is
we need to pay due attention.

Long-term rabies, the fed hurt are corrosive products,
undermine our disposition, joy and good cheer when we give them shelter.

As we find ourselves in the process of learning, it is natural that, in the
tribulations and frictions of everyday life, arise these emotions that provoke
distonias.

We should not be frightened, let alone deny that within us there is still space
and welcome to less noble feelings and emotions.

However, when i perceive their presence, it is up to each of us to use the resources
necessary to minimize them, diminishing their influence until they are
dissolved and eliminated.

So if revenge is disease, forgiveness is healing. If the hurt is the cause of the
pain, understanding is the remedy that relieves.

If anger disturbs us, compassion will reassure us.

And all these remedies should be used for their own benefit and improves
intimate, for the greatest harmed by our unbalanced emotions, we are
Same.

Let us never allow ourselves to harbor our feelings-pains for the long term.
Fatally they will cause deep dystonias in our souls, demanding greater and
more extensive resources for the necessary cure.

Therefore, before melancholy, depression, or other difficulties are
install in our soul, we renew our intimate landscape.

Every effort we use in this regard will be investment in health itself
Spiritual. Also maturing for other clashes that will come, in the process
learning and soul improvement.

We measure about it and make adjustments to our feelings and emotions,
shaping ourselves to the law of love, for our own health and happiness.
