A traveler walked along the shores of a large lake of crystal clear waters and
imagined a way to get to the other side, where his destiny was.

He sighed deeply as he tried to fix his gaze on the horizon. The voice of a
white-haired man broke momentary silence, offering himself to
transport it. He was a boatman.

The small aged boat, on which the crossing would be carried out, was provided
of two oak wood oars.

The traveler looked detained and realized what appeared to be letters in each row.
By putting dusty feet inside the boat, he observed that they were even two
Words.

One of the oars was notched the word believe and the other, act.

Unable to contain curiosity, asked the reason for those original names
given to the oars.

The boatman took the paddle, in which it was written to believe, and paddled with all
Force.

The boat then started going around, leaving the place it was.

Then he took the paddle in which it was written to act and paddled with all vigor.

Again the boat spun in the opposite direction, without going ahead.

Finally, the old boatman, holding the two oars, moved them to the same
time and the boat, driven by both sides, sailed through the waters of the
lake, arriving calmly on the other shore.

Then the boatman told the traveler:

This boat can be called self-confidence. And the margin is the goal we want
Reach.

In order for the self-confidence boat to navigate safely and reach the desired goal, it is
I need us to use the two oars at the same time, and with the same
intensity: act and believe.

It's not enough just to believe, otherwise the boat will be spinning in circles. It is necessary to
also act, to move it in the direction that will lead us to reach our
meta.

Act and believe. Boost the oars with force and will, overcoming the
waves and the gales and do not forget that sometimes it is necessary to paddle against the
Tide.

                                   *   *   *

Gandhi had a goal: to free his people from the English yoke. There was also a
strategy: nonviolence.

His self-confidence was so much that he reached his bloodless goal.
Not only did he believe it was possible, but he also acted safely.

Mother Teresa also had a goal: to help calcutta's abandoned poor.
He believed and acted, overcoming the initial goal, helping poor people around the world.

Albert Schweitzer traced his goal and got there. Left the comfort of the city
large and got caught up in the jungle of French Africa to meet the natives, in the
more complete anonymity.

Like these, we would have so many other examples of men and women that not only
believed but that made their plans of happiness and redemption come true
particular.

                                   *   *   *

What about you? Are you firmly holding back to achieve the goal you've set?

If the boat of your self-confidence is stopped in the middle of the road or walking in
circles, it's time to make a decision and boost it with force and willingness.

Remember that only you can trigger it using the two oars: act and
Believe.

                                   *   *   *

If you do not already have a goal set or wish to redo yours, consider
some points:

make sure that the paths you will go through will not be invading the property
third-party parties;

whether the waters you wish to navigate are protected from the gutters of envy, the
pride, hatred;

and, before moving the boat, make sure the oars are not corroded by the
acid of selfishness.

After taking all these precautions, go ahead and have a good trip.
