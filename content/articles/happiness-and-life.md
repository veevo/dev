Earthly humanity goes through difficult, complicated times, never imagined by present generations.

Many wonder where the joy of living is, in the face of the sad reality we face.

As man has progressed scientifically and technologically, his joy seems distant or impossible.

The achievements made by the human being, in the last decades, in the micro and macrocosm, make a feeling of power feed his ego.

Realizing that it can penetrate, unravel and manipulate the microscopic world is a source of great pride.

To look at the stars, and to know the means of reaching some, to approach others, to analyze them through their powerful apparatus, makes him vain.

These discoveries allow the creature to begin to feel somewhat creative because it has no other view of the reality of life.

And despite all these achievements, you do not feel true joy.

*   *   *

When man understands himself as a child of God, heir to this Supreme Intelligence of the Universe and First Cause of all that exists, he will change his way of being.

When you realize that you are an immortal Spirit, of which you know nothing in the face of much to learn, you will put aside your foolish pride.

When you accept yourself as someone who needs a great deal of achievement toward goodness, you will diminish the vanity that strikes you.

*   *   *

We need to dive into reality: as long as we live only in pursuit of material achievements, we are only treading the horizontal line of life.

As we seek growth, also in the vertical line, improving ourselves in the conquest of virtues, ethics, moral feeling, joy will visit us.

One might argue how we can talk about joy in the midst of so much suffering on the planet.

So let's think: As we are willing to live life with joy, we need to look at situations with other glasses. For example, suffering is bad, but not bad, because it offers valuable resources for the acquisition of permanent good.

Therefore, having joy does not prevent the approach of suffering, since it is part of our process of evolution.

Understanding this fact, we do not abandon joy, even because we can learn from pain and evolve into God.

When love is not present in feeling, joy does not flourish, because it remains shadowed by doubt and suspicion.

People say they want joy, happiness, but they can't get it, no matter how much they pursue it.

Joy is not found in markets or pharmacies, but in the heart that feels and loves.

Whenever possible express the joy of living.

If we have already met Jesus, we have a better reason for joy, because wrapped in the Light of the world, no shadow threatens.

Let us rejoice in the life we u200bu200benjoy, and let us always thank the glory of knowing and loving, to act right.

Life with joy is itself a hymn of praise to God.
