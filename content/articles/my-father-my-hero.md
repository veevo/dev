When I came into this world, I wasn't sure what I was doing here,
until I realized there was someone to guide me on the journey.

One day, when you raised me in your arms, rising above your head,
found out you wanted me to realize the world from a very
Comprehensive.

When I started rehearsing my first steps, with the musculature of my legs
yet fragile, you sustained me holding my hand, and understood that you did not
wished to carry me on my lap forever: he wanted me to walk with his own
Legs.

When I first came home, panting, complaining about friends,
you told me to settle with them, and i understood i should assume the
responsibility for my own acts.

When I brought home my first lesson and you sat next to me,
guiding me but didn't do the lesson to me, I understood that you wished the
learning was an achievement of mine.

The day some other people's objects ended up in my school backpack,
you, without offending me, asked me to return to the rightful owner, and understood that
You wanted to make me an honest person.

When, one day, my friends left the room and traced some mean comments
about them, and you told me we shouldn't speak ill of the absent people,
I learned the lessons of sincerity and respect.

In the difficult moments, you were always by my side to support me, and in the
Joyous hours didn't miss me his hug to share.

When I faltered in the face of the first clash of life, you told me of courage...

When I cried the tears caused by the first suffering, you told me of
Resignation...

When I wanted to escape the commitments that presented themselves, you told me about
Responsibility...

When I thought About lying to a friend, you told me about fidelity...

When I felt in my soul the scourges of the first gales, you told me of
flexibility, and i learned to bend myself not to break, like the small branch
green does before the blows of the wind.

When you sensed in my look at the insinuation of revenge, you told me about the
Forgiveness...

When I wished to save the world, in the burning days of youth, you taught me
moderation and common sense.

When you wanted to submit to the group's fads, you told me about freedom.

When I was deceived, thinking that the world was mine, you told me about the Creator of the
Universe...

So, my father, I wish to say that you have always been my hero, my friend, my
great master, my walking companion...

You were firm, when it was firm that I needed...

You were tender when you were tender that I needed... You were lucid,
when it was lucid i needed...

When I came into this world, I wasn't sure what I was doing here,
until I realized there was someone to guide me on the journey...

Today, well, today I clearly know what I'm doing here, because you, my
father, did more than just guide me, you walked beside me many times,
followed me up many others, and walked before me many others,
leaving traces of light, as safe guidelines That I could follow.

Today I know very well the role that fits me in building a better world,
because this I learned from you, my great and admired friend...

And when I see so many lost young people, aimless and hopeless, wandering
between violence and death, I ask God for them, because it is quite possible that
have not had the happiness of having a father like you...

And I ask God for you, Dad, my great friend.
