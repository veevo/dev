Spiritism teaches that Divine Laws are inscribed in nature and
in the consciousness of every Spirit.

Who is dedicated to observing the world that surrounds it, can assimilate the content of
such Laws.

However, the safest guide is consciousness.

For a time, selfishness hinders the perception of Divine status.

Selfishness originates from identification with matter.

The more tuned to the material pleasures, the more difficulty man has
to be selfless.

In the lower circles of life, selfishness represents a condition of
Survival.

Irrational beings are only concerned with their maintenance.

When hungry, carnivorous animals simply hunt and kill.

If they are not skilled and insensitive to the pain of prey, they and their cubs die.

A very striking selfishness is a sign of little evolution.

Those who can only think of their own well-being resemble the beasts of nature.

The world revolves around his navel and he doesn't bother to cause pain and
misfortunes to the like.

However, spirits are endowed with freedom, conscience, and will.

Consequently, they answer for their acts.

No being can give what you don't have.

Animal ethical actions are not expected, as this is beyond their ability.

But men are able to act on ethical parameters.

Precisely for this reason, their acts cannot be dictated exclusively by the
personal interest.

Nature's painful events, such as suffering, sickness and death, are
Universal.

No one escapes trying them to a greater or lesser extent.

Human intelligence makes it possible to assimilate the essential equality of all
Men.

This similarity demonstrates that being supportive is an elementary duty in the face of
Life.

Over the centuries, gradually, the Spirit penetrates this
Reality.

Everything that refers to the matter is fleeting.

However, he has a consciousness that always accompanies him.

Every pain deliberately caused to the next one in it is recorded.

Levity, the humiliations inflicted, all this generates pain and repentance.

The more lived and experienced, the more responsible the Spirit is.

There comes a time when the spiritual being dislikes evil.

Tired of errors and rascalities, he decides to work for his own improvement.

Then prepare for you incarnations in which you can recompose with the past.

You no longer care about material facilities.

Wealth, beauty and power no longer interest you.

When you take high positions, it is only in order to better work for the
Similar.

What counts even is the prospect of recomporiting itself before divine laws.

As he loses his taste for material things, selfishness abandons him.

Untangled from petty concerns, he walks vigorously to the
liberation and transcendence.

Difficulties do not scare him, for his goal is high and his hope for the future
it's infinite.

                                   *   *   *

If you face serious problems and pain, the time has come to
your reckoning.

Do not complicate your scheduled spiritual recovery with laziness and revolt.

Aware of the transience of life on Earth, detain to conquer what is
Permanent.

Fight your selfishness and strive to act well with disinterest.

The best way to be happy is to take care of the happiness of others.

Think about it.
