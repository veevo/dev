There were four women. They talked, in a distracted manner, while waiting for the
medical consultation. At one point, detailing episodes of their lives, they spent
to speak, each of which, of the greatest mistake made.

There were diverse and antagonistic situations and each of them believed to have been
which was presenting its biggest mistake.

However, the biggest mistake of their lives they were making there, in that
moment, in the heart of the doctor's office: they all smoked.

They brought with voluptuousness and seemed to delight in forming arabesques with smoke,
in mid-air.

From time to time, the woman has exposed herself to diseases that, previously,
less often reached it. Such, for example, death from a heart attack and
various types of cancer.

When the woman is pregnant, the size of the error increases since, when the
pregnant women smoke, the fetus also smokes, receiving toxic substances that,
through maternal circulation, they cross the placenta.

With the use of cigarettes, there is an increased risk of abortion, bleeding and
other complications. More often, the delivery of the smoking woman complicates,
still at risk of premature detachment from the placenta and rupture
of the bag.

The risk of sudden infant death also increases according to the number of
cigarettes consumed in pregnancy.

In general, in a greater proportion the birth of children with lower weight and
less length, in smoking mothers, as well as the risk of the baby being born with
birth defects.

In addition to assaulting themselves, destroying physical machinery, they are very
the baby, with repercussion for his life.

Smoking during pregnancy compromises the child's intelligence, with the child being less
intellectual income of the children of smoking mothers.

Serious error still makes woman who breastfeeds and smokes, as nicotine passes
milk and is absorbed by the child.

And what about the risk of young children contracting respiratory infections,
such as bronchitis, pneumonia and asthma complications, when they are required to
living in environments polluted by cigarette smoke?

It is certainly serious that the female mistake of inturning to tobacco addiction,
destroying themselves, and often complicating the lives of those for which it is
Responsible.

The smoking woman who gets pregnant and abandons addiction, to preserve integrity
the baby's physical in formation, affirms with his attitude his ability to love.
