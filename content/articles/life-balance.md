How are you doing? It is always online, connected to social networks, knowing of
almost everything about what do your friends and friends of your friends do?

Always up to date with gossip in real time?

You are one of those who cannot stay disconnected at any time, for fear
miss the latest news?

Do you have hundreds and hundreds of virtual friends and boast about it?

Among these, it is possible that people have never seen, nor do they have any good
clear the idea of where they live, which they truly appreciate.

Also, for sure, long friends.

Answer now: How long have you not met in person?

However, personal contact is very important, as nothing replaces the heat
of a hug, a deep eye-to-eyes.

So don't miss the chance to feel the heat of a handshake, the
pleasant feeling of hearing the heart of the friend beating hurried, before the emotion
of the reunion.

Enjoy these moments, promote them and live them in full.

And when you leave the house, take the opportunity to observe your surroundings. Leave the appliance
in the pocket or purse.

You are used to receiving dozens of images daily, via virtual,
spectacular, from paradisiacal places and with them is ecstatic.

However, you stop enjoying the garden of your home, the street beds
where it transits.

He noticed that a yellow rose blossomed and pours colorful petals,
carpeting the floor?

He noticed that the wind of the night tore the leaves of the bushes and prepared a
delicate nest of cuteness on the grass?

Did you realize that the tree shakes its branches, in greeting you, that passes?

It felt like the delicate exude scent extension, in response to the
fustigar from the rain of dawn?

If you're with friends, turn off your phone, forget about the iPad, stay offline.

And connect, stay online with whoever's with you. Eyes on the eyes, talk,
Listen.

It has been said that the human voice is the most excellent musical instrument there is
upon earth. Serve himself as the one who fingers the ropes or caresss a
Keyboard.

Listen and grave, in the acoustics of the soul, the voice of your friends, each with your
timbre particular.

Listen to what they say. They will be able to narrate details of the fantastic trip, which
accomplished earlier and you will share your enthusiasm.

Or, who knows, will hear them account of the pains that embrace them and may
wipe some tears.

One day, when loneliness involves you, you can close your eyes, trigger the
memories and hear the crystalclear sound of laughter or the babbling of a hiccup.

That's living, living.

Think about it. Analyze. And put it into practice today. Phone. (Don't send a
torpedo or enter a message). Phone and arrange an exit with your friends,
with his cousins, nephews.

Indulging in the smiles, with the company. Then repeat this several other
times, plenifying themselves with happiness, feeling the irresistible will to
to reprise the same wholesome emotions, which nourish the soul and rejoice the
Hours.
