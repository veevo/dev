Life often offers us opportunities to circumvent our
Emotions.

To do so, it puts in our way excellent teachers.

Some are able to offer their values by example. They are the most
who teach us through their behavior.

These exemplify the exercise of patience, understanding, without the need to
speeches or concepts. They only experience, in a simple and relaxed way.

However, there are those who teach us differently. How they still bring
emotional limitations similar to ours, what they present are clashes, in
that mix mutual misunderstandings, discussions and intolerance about
certain views.

Not often, the result hurts us, hurts us. We feel raped, while at the
at the same time, we also react, hurting.

As we still lack the conquest of understanding and the emotional upholstery of
tolerance, conflicts arise, gaining panoramas of complex wingspan, from which
sorrows are born.

So often positive, cheerful, loving feelings have not yet been
rooted in us, end up replaced by resentment.

However, every conflict offers an opportunity for self-knowledge and learning.

If we find ourselves in the situation of the hurt, it is up to us to extend the lesson of forgiveness.

If the other hurt us, it is because it still has its limitations, its difficulties
Internal.

We must seek to slowly transform sorrow into understanding, which
will allow us to heal the emotional wound we carry.

To do this, let us thoroughly analyze the true causes of our sorrow,
for the difficulty in forgiving lies in our own hearts.

Once the cause is identified, let us strive to acquire tolerance, understanding and
capacity for forgiveness.

However, if we were the cause of such feeling in others, it is up to us to seek
for apologies, forgiveness and compensation.

First, we need to identify the misunderstanding in us, and trigger the
self-forgiveness, for in order to forgive the other it is necessary to feel
peace, which self-forgiveness will provide us.

No accommodation with the situation or the search for reasons that justify us, but
understanding that we are errorable.

The next step is the search for the forgiveness of the other, recognizing our misunderstanding,
expressing sincere repentance.

If he doesn't want to forgive us, it's his right. For our part, let's leave the
door open to reconciliation, as we move forward, without carrying
complex fault, nor feeling victims.

In these hours, the best way is to invest efforts to modify the
behavior, altering our attitudes.

That's learning from mistakes. Recognize our mistakes, our own
limits to, from then on, conquer virtues and expand our
emotional boundaries.

Thus, one way or another, the lesson is for life, for growth
for the aggrandizement of the Spirit.

Hurting, seeking forgiveness. Hurt, offer understanding, without harboring in the
soul any feeling of inferior order.

Let us think about it and try to act to keep what can us
do evil or harbor in the soul less noble feelings.
