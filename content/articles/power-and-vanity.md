There is a lot of talk about human miseries. There is talk, greatly, of misery
Economic.

But, beside material miseries there are others of greater gravity, which are the
moral miseries.

Vanity is one of them. It blends into all human actions and stains the
more delicate thoughts. Penetrate the heart and brain.

Bad plant, vanity muffles goodness. All qualities are annihilated by
its poison.

It causes men to forget God, who constitutes aid only
begged in the moments of affliction, and never the Friend invited to the feast of the
Joy.

Vanity alone is an obstacle to the moral progress of men,
but when it is holding hands with power, it becomes harmful.

In the times when galilee's dusty roads were still marked by the
humble sandals of sublime Galileo, a singular teaching was printed
in history, through a dialogue of Christ with a Roman senator.

Jesus spoke to him of humility but, that man vested in powers and glories
transient, let himself be swept away by a wave of pride and questioned himself
Mentally:

Humility? What credentials presented the prophet to speak to him like this, to him,
senator of the Roman Empire, clothed with all powers?

He recalled the city of Caesars, covered with triumphs and glories, whose monuments
believed, at that moment, to be immortal.

Jesus, knowledgeable of the eternal and immutable laws that govern life, realizing
his thoughts, answered with serenity and firmness:

All the powers of your empire are very weak and all their riches well
Miserable...

Caesars' magnificences are one-day ephemeral illusions, for all
wise, like all warriors, are called at the opportune moment to
courts of justice of My Father who is in Heaven.

One day, they will no longer exist their powerful eagles under a handful of ashes
misérrimas. Your sciences will become the breath of the efforts of others
workers more worthy of progress.

Their unjust laws will be brought into the dark abyss of these centuries of
wickedness, because only one Law exists and will survive the rubble of restlessness
of man: The Law of love, instituted by My Father, from the beginning of the
Creation...

In these jesus sayings, there is a singular teaching: the transience of
human ostentatious built under the impositions of vanity.

And Jesus was right. Two millennia after, little left of that Empire
regarded as immortal. There are only a few ruins left today that time will take care of
to extinguish.

However, time will not destroy the great legacy teachings to
Humanity by Roman citizens who have dedicated themselves to building heritage
non-subject to the laws of matter.

                                    *  *  *

God, before putting humanity on the face of the earth adorned her with beauties
have covered it with all the elements and resources necessary for our
Welfare.

To illuminate the day, He gave us the sun, glorious radiation. And to clear the
nights peppered them with stars, as if they were golden flowers.

What do we have to offer God but our hearts?

But far from bewitching him with joys, virtues and hopes and allowing him to
God penetrates him, we only do it when mourning, bitterness and disappointments in the
visit and harm us.

Let's put vanity aside and offer our heart pain-free.

Let us offer him to God as men, standing, not as slaves, on his knees.
Let us also remember God in the hours of joy and happiness.
