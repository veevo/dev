One theme very debated these days is violence.

The media bring, daily, reports, articles, interviews,
addressing the theme. That makes us worry and think of a possible
solution to the problem.

But, after all, who promotes so much violence on our planet?

If anyone asked if we were violent, many would answer, without further
long, that's not.

However, violence is not just about the cruelty of wars, in the
brutality of crimes against the like. She's also in the minimums
events of everyday life.

If we look closely at the everyday facts, we will notice
so many other facets of violence that until then we had not detected.

In speaking, on the floor, in the small gestures, our body can leave in sight the
violence we bring in intimacy.

Indifference, slouch, intolerance, lying, impatience are forms
violence that affects those who live to our derredor.

The indifference to the events concerning us, whether it is
in the home, whether in the society that surrounds us, can be the cause of violence that,
although it is not evident, it will give rise to her later speaking.

The slouch with the things that belong to us, or with the obligations that we
may be a factor in generating violence.

A simple disregard with the vehicle we drive, the lack of revision, the parts
involving accidents involving us or to third parties, it is violence.

The car deregulated, spreading smoke in the air that others breathe, or
hindering the sight of other drivers, or even making noises
unbearable, are forms of violence.

Impatience in traffic, in our work environment, at home, leisure,
unpleasant situations that favor violence.

As we can see, violence has many faces. Some manifests and
other hidden ones.

It is worth meditating on these issues and rethinking our concept about the
Subject. Let's watch and think if we haven't been fosterers of violence
that we abhor so much, without realizing it.

If we sincerely want to build a pacified world, it is not enough just not to
practice violence. We need to feed peace wherever we are.

For, being evil always audacious, where there is no serenity, peace, it there
settles in.

Therefore, let us spread peace to our meltdown, avoiding the action
violence, whatever level it is.

Acting like this, we will be effectively contributing to the construction of a
world without violence.

                                   *   *   *

The flower, which scents, identifies with the air, as to thank the
granting of life.

The man, who leads peace as if a lamp lit over his heart,
spreads tranquility wherever he is, and identifies himself with the Lord
of Life.
