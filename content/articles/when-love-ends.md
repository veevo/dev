Suddenly, what was light is made shadow. The time of dating, delicacies and
passionate looks give way to bitterness, the aridity of the days.

And a lot of people say, love is over!

A sentence that falls heavy on the shoulders of those who listen. The end of love perhaps
be the saddest news for a human being. After all, love moves the world and
fills life with joy.

But does love end? After all, it is a feeling so strong that it goes beyond the
barrier of personal relationships and water out in social relationships.

Where there is a human groupthere is the need for love.

Love of parents, children, friends. Love between a man and a woman. That
care what kind is love?

It is enough that it exists for your perfume to immediately transform the
environments, light enonise the eyes, make the air lighter.

And if love is so essential, why do we let it end? Why do we allow
he gets anamesquine and suffocated?

It's just that we don't always know how to prioritize what's really important. Not always
we know how to take care of the people we love the most.

Sometimes we treat just those we want most well. They are ours
parents, siblings, spouses and children...

They should be our priority, but they always seem to be in last place.
For them we should keep the gestures of delicacy, the cuddles, the words
Tribe.

Even worse is when we allow the abysses and silences to happen in our
Home.

It's like a cancer, which starts slowly, installs itself and becomes
Uncontrollable.

And it all starts because we stopped talking, exchanging experiences,
share the space we call home. And so we're moving away from beings
Loved.

And there's still negligence. We stopped talking, smiling, paying attention to those of
Home.

Concentrated on people with whom we have purely social contact, gradually
we replaced the family group with friends, co-workers and even people
that we just met.

So let's let life go on. Suddenly, when we realize, time
passed, the children are adults, the brothers married, the parents died.

Or they're too old to have a fun conversation in the afternoon.
The train of life followed and we didn't even see him pass.

That's when repentance comes, longing, the will to stay together another
Little.

It is not always necessary to wait: someone who dies suddenly, an accident, a
unexpected illness.

And we realized, then, that we wasted the time we were next to that
special person; of that fun son; of that devoted mother; that father
loving; of that companion who was right next door, walking along.

No. Love doesn't die. We let him wither, go out.
inattention and laziness that stifle love.

But just water carefully, smiles and affection, so that he revives.

As a ricket plant, love drinks the words we direct and rises.

Love never dies. Even if we believe he's dead and buried,
who disappeared, he just waits for a gesture to revive him.

Try! Look at the people in your family, for your love, and remember
of the beautiful things they lived.

Don't let bad memories contaminate you. Focus all your attention on the
happier moments.

Embrace, cuddle, smile along, tell them how much you love them.

And if suddenly your heart accelerates, your eyes turn damp and a
indescribable sense of happiness take care of you, have no doubt: are
the contagious and delicious effects of love.
