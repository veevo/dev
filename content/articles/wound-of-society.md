You know what the worst feeling of man is, the one who is the root of all
evils that congratulate you?

If you still didn't know, then pay attention to the response given by the Wise
Spirits, to Allan Kardec: We have said it many times: selfishness. From there drift
all evil. Study all the vices and you will see that deep down there is selfishness.

Whoever wants, from this life, to go closer to moral perfection, must
purge your heart of every sense of selfishness, since selfishness is
incompatible with justice, love and charity. It neutralizes all other
Qualities.

As the superior Spirits say, selfishness is incompatible with justice, the
love and charity. And this is clearly perceived in the most varied situations
of a people or a nation.

When we analyze, with exemption from mind, the social injustices in force in
any country in the world, we will detect men, social classes, parties
defending their interests, to the detriment of justice.

The selfish thinks only of you. You want your rights respected, but you don't think
respect the rights of others. His view of justice is one-sided.

It is for this reason that humanity is grappling with violence, with the
corruption, with the supremacy of personal interests over what is fair.

It is because of selfishness that wars erupted, from the small conflicts
religious wars, even the great wars of world reach.

But when there is a feeling of brotherhood, solidarity, altruism
in the hearts of men, these give up personal interests in favour of
justice and common well-being.

In a civilized society, every citizen is entitled to what is necessary, which is the
right to food, housing, health and school.

Violence only shuts down in the face of justice and love. But of a justice that
come out of the paper and words to come true in all fields of the
Society.

As long as there is selfishness, there will be no love or justice.

For all this, it is necessary to eradicate this social wound called selfishness, of
once and for all, so that we can glimpse the possibility of a
society in which justice and fraternity are a reality.

And this cancer will only be excised from man's heart when the scalpel of
education is wisely manipulated.

When the germ of love is implanted into the child's heart, he shall flourish and
bear fruit capable of neutralizing hatred and injustice.

And that will be due to education. An education based on the example and maximum
that establishes to do to the other what we would like the other in the
Do.

*   *   *

As men become true about spiritual things, less value
give them material things.

Then, necessary is for the reform of human institutions that excite the
selfishness and keep him alive. That depends on education.

Not education that makes educated men, but the way good men.

Think about it!
