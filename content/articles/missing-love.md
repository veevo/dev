A video circulated on social media. It showed something quite simple and
valuable: teenage children, young people, calling their parents to say
simply: I love you.

They were unexpected cell phone calls at any time of the day.
they answered, heard a hello and soon after: Father, Mother, I wanted to say that I love you. Just
I called to say that.

The reactions were beautiful. Parents saying, Wow, how good to hear that. I
I love you too, my son.

And on the side of here, who was making the calls, in the same way: tears
of emotion of young people who had rarely, or never uttered such words.

As if the simple contact with these magic words, when truly
felt, already provoked in them some kind of transformation.

Many can say that love is implied, it is in gestures, in company
daily, does not require evidence. And that maybe it doesn't have to be declared.

Many fear it is pieguism to express themselves in this way. Is?

We trivialize the I love you, that's for sure, reciting it from the mouth out many times,
Automatically.

The overwhelming and ephemeral passions appropriated him, making him minor, for
in the same way that love is born, voracious, also dies, sad, little time
then in empty relationships.

I love you from the decorated altars, the big parties, you can't survive the
first weather of many marriages.

This love of infinite songs, of beautiful works, but also of purely
sentimentalists, who add nothing to true art.

Curious. The I love you has been told so many times that it seems to have weakened by the
around the world, practically falling into oblivion.

                                   *   *   *

There's no lack of love in the poems, in the songs, in the mouths. There's still a lack of love.

There is no lack of love in homes, in families: there is no need to love.

There is no lack of love in thoughts, in ideas: there is no need to love.

There is no lack of love in the powers of our soul. There is, yes, the movement of love.

And often, the pure and simple expression of this love is already much of that
Love.

When we truly feel within ourselves this profound affection, this
want well, this awareness of how important that person is, nothing more
natural than to say, than extravasate.

Good for those who say, because they soak up their benfazejas vibrations and
Invigorating.

Good for those who listen, because they get a lot more than words. It receives comfort, the
warmth and gratitude that such a statement holds itself.

Listening to a Real I love you, it's like being taken by your hands for a walk, a
journey to a better world, of less worries and suffering, a reflector
to the soul in struggle on earth.

We return renewed, willing to move forward and more, we come back knowing the
love a little better.

We still know little of love in its depth. We're giving the first
steps after leaving the necessary primitivism.

It remains to love to find him and stay in it longer.

We need to love so we can declare it without fear of impoverished pieguism.

There's just one left to love, that's all.
