The Earth took us in when we were born. The planet that saw our birth
ancestors should also see the arrival of our descendants.

Long after we leave the soil of this Earth, the sun will warm up the
men of the future who will live here. And what world we will have left for generation
tomorrow?

We don't usually think about the generosity of the earth that received us, offering
fruits and flowers, shade and water.

On the contrary, over the centuries, we soaked the soil with substances
corrosive, we have reviewed the land in search of riches, we kill trees,
we contaminate water, waste resources, pollute the air.

Finally, we remain forgotten that natural resources need renovation and
Care. The carelessness of millennia then, after all, arose.

Today, the results are right ahead of us: acid rain, rivers that have become
almost solid, mountains of garbage.

Animals and plants that die, which become extinct as if they were bubbles that
simply burst into the air.

Our agonizing planet, stifled by our dissent.

Can we really do something? What attitude to take?

Believe me, we can all, yes, repay the generosity of this earth that
nourishes their children.

Today is a day of a new beginning, day of loving earth more, nature.

Look for a few moments at the clear sky. Think of the clean air entering your
Lungs. And in honor of all this, leave the car at home... for a day that
Be.

For a moment only, remember the flowers that sprout in windows and balconies.
Wild, urban flowers, flowers in pink, red, orange, white and yellow.

Record of this perfume and beauty. And reciprocate, avoiding the waste that becomes
the mountain of garbage that buries the flowers.

Now, keep in mind the light streams, the water currents, the immense rivers,
the formidable ocean.

Think of every glass of fresh water that satiates thirst and make a gesture of gratitude:
save water whenever you can.

In these small gestures of everyday life, we will be able to reverse the picture of
present days. Gradually, we will be obliged – by the very instinct of
survival – to take more care of the world in which we live.

And if man commits that commitment to himself, who knows one day,
again, there will be clean air, blue sky, clean water and a lovely place to
Live.

But don't be fooled. It all depends - and a lot - on you. From the gestures of
environmental responsibility you take, of the examples you give, of education
that offer to their children.

This is a time of choices, decisions.

Think about it. And one day, when your physical eyes have closed in this
world –-even if men no longer remember that you lived here, your
memory will be alive in the breeze that shakes the leaves, in the streams of water.

The perfumes and colors of the Earth will remember you and your gestures of love.

                                   *   *   *

It's up to each of us to the Land of tomorrow. Both morally and physically.

We'll be leaving in a few years. But we will return to this world, others
times, at other times, in new bodies.

What do we want to find on our return?

Let's think about it now!
