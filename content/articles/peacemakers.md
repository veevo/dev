More and more frequent is made the number of those frightened by violence
social.

The occurrences that seemed distant, in the news, today are facts in our
social and family relationships.

We are all touched by violence, if not personally, through someone from the
our family circle or friends.

It's no longer just an abstract comment to be a reality to get along with.

Fearing her, many lock ourselves in the house, we close ourselves and for the
World.

Victimized by violence, some adhered to it, making us aggressive, in a
mechanism of animal defense instinct.

We arm ourselves, schedule revenge, plan reactions in the face of a possible
theft, a family invasion, or an approach on the public road.

Victims we feel of violence, we use it themselves for what
we claim to be our self-defense.

Without realizing that by doing so, we just thickenthe ranks of
violent, we began to act as agents of evil.

However, many get tired of violence, no longer supporting living in this
endless exchange of being assaulted and retaliated, being a victim and tormentor.

Exhausted and somewhat more mature, we realized that it is necessary to find
mechanisms for effective combat against it.

We are the ones who elect peace as the great antidote, not limiting ourselves to their
concept, to its concept or in only to quote it in catchphrases of effect.

We are the ones who become peacemakers, because we begin to experience,
cultivate and multiply peace.

Our actions are no longer reactive and become proactive.

We are not allowed to be easy targets of other people's violence, but also not
we choir, we don't even let ourselves be contaminated by it.

We are men and women who have decided that our talk and our action must be of
peace and peace.

We are the people who, mistreated in traffic by the rudeness of others, we act with
Kindness.

When affected by the lack of urbanity of some, in the daily treatment,
we chose to offer attitudes of citizenship and respect.

And when we face achaques, bad mood and rudeness of a family member or a
co-worker, we keep ourselves in the silence of the peace we cultivate, waiting for
time to resume dialogue.

We are the peacemakers of the world. We are the ones who are turning the Earth into
a world of peace.

We are the ones who have been able to understand the Franciscan proposal and adhere to it: Where
there is violence, that I take peace.

We unite in this proposal.

Let us make our actions, attitudes, dialogues, a hymn to peace.

If we are faced with violence in the world, that we can offer attitudes of
Peace.

It will be only in this way, with an invasion of peacemakers that violence will be
banned, finding no more place in society.

May this change come from us, that we are the first to join the
peace, making us their most dedicated and valuable craftsmen.

Before the voice of the aggressive, let us be the voice of serenity.

In turmoil, we bow and summon others to pacification, whose
immediate effects are tranquility, harmony, in fostering peace.
