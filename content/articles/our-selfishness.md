Daily, there are numerous demonstrations of selfishness from us or our
Time.

It's the driver who stops the car in a double line, just for a minute.

The fan who, to celebrate the victory of his sports team, comes out with his
car honking through the streets, regardless of time and place.

It is the religious who, on the pretext of serving his faithful, transmits his act
liturgical through speakers.

The passenger who enters the public transport and runs to take the empty place,
without looking at whether there are any elderly, any pregnant lady, or a mother with child,
that would need to traffic better accommodated.

It is the celebrations with fireworks, without considering sick in the
hospitals, children sleeping in homes.

It is the one who seeks to stick the line, trying a way, disregarding those who
came before him.

It is parents who behave with intolerance and irritation when the child
little one does not behave properly in the restaurant, demanding attention and
causing delay to your meal.

Hinder the movement of vehicles by not giving the turn to the driver who is
leaving the garage, parking or trying to enter a preferred route.

On the pretext of being in a hurry, treat family members rudely and
Stupidity.

Hold the elevator door while completing the conversation or bid
lengthy.

Park your vehicle, without observing whether you are occupying more than one vacancy, or if
will not lock or hinder the movement of other vehicles.

Unfortunately, there are many examples to be explicit selfishness data.

Selfishness is one of humanity's great evils, also because it is a source of
of pride, of arrogance, of ingratitude, disorder, rebellion, of
violence, of sovinice, of indifference.

The first step in combating this evil in us is to examine us carefully
and intent, identifying the selfish attitudes of each day, from the most
to the most relevant ones.

Then begin to bend this misguided personality by imposing measures
corrective, intentionally corrective.

Here are some very simple tips:

at home, do not rush or run over everything and all, to have time to watch
telenovela or news;

don't leave the kids hungry, hoping you'll finish watching that
or that program on television, or that you complete the long conversation to the
telephone;

if your child asks you to play together, leave the newspaper or
magazine for later, and go amuse it, with all the attention and goodwill;

if you are taking care of your child, seek activities concerning age
and at his will, and not insist that he do what you want. Don't stay
beside him only while he plays. Play with him, roll on the floor, live
his world;

sitting at the table for the meal, try to serve others, first,
with patience and zeal;

when you bathe, do it properly, but quickly. There are people in the
row;

when you finish your bath, leave the bathroom in use conditions for others,
so that they do not have to clean up before use;

rather than asking for things at home, anticipate yourself and provide what
you want, on your own;

help in the storage of the house, taking care not to mess it;

When getting up in the morning, do it without haste, fix your bed, help in the
care of minors, provide breakfast, treat everyone with
courtesy and sympathy;

when leaving home, be courteous in traffic, public transport, streets,
elevators, stops with the attendants, to the co-workers.

Selfishness must be superimposed by altruism. In selfishness you are the only and the
First. In altruism, the neighbor exists and deserves all his dedication.

Loving others like yourself has taught Jesus for over two thousand years.

It is more than time to modify our selfishness of each day, for the
our altruism of every day.

Think about it!
