Nothing more common in terrenaactivities than the rooted habit of
disagreements, annoying.

Nothing more common among human individuals.

Like a field of boys, in which each gesture, each note, each mention becomes a
good reason for strife and misunderstandings, also in the society of adults the
same phenomenon occurs.

More than understandable is that you, similar to a boy of short wick,
release adrenaline in everyday episodes that challenge your stability
Emotional.

Understandable that one is enforced, that he is angry, that he praises the voice, which buckles the
ugly expressions of various hues.

By virtue of the level of your inner world, all this is possible to happen.

However, you did not come to Earth to fix deficiencies, but to treat them,
cultivating health.

You don't think in the world to submit to irrational impulses, but to
make them mature into the fields of lucid reason.

You were not born to get carried away by the detempero, by the irritation that
disarticulates balance, but has a duty to educate yourself, because it has on the agenda of
his life the commitment to cooperate with God as he grows, who
mature, to be ennobled.

Thus, their daily annoyances, although they are permissible in souls
children's and detemperate, are already beginning to cause unfortunate noises,
disconcerting and undesirable, in the souls in the world to give
counts of blessed commitments with Jesus Christ and His prepositions.

So, be sure, get to know yourself in the learning of good, a little more. Strive
for improving.

Resist a little more the impulses of the beast that still rounds his experiences
Intimate.

Get a little closer to the Spiritual Benefactors who supported him.

In the face of other people's disorders, learn to analyze and not repeat.

Faced with someone's rebellion, analyze and remove the lesson so that it does not
Same.

Noting someone's violent explosion, reflect on the damaging consequences in order to
not to do the same.

Every effort you make to improve yourself, by educating yourself, will be seconded by the
help from immortal luminous people who are, at all times, investing in their
progress, so that, little by little, but always, you grow and light up,
making himself victorious co-worker with God, having overcome himself,
turning their moral nights into radiose evenings of perennial beauty.

When you are visited for a cause of suffering or setback,
overlap with her.

And when he has succeeded in dominating the urges of impatience, anger, or
despair, say, from self to you, full of just satisfaction: I was the most
Strong.
