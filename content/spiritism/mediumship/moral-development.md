For anyone interested in exercising the [Mediumship](/spiritism/mediumship), a life long commitment that requires deep personal growth and modification
is expected. Mediumship is not just learning about Spiritism through books or a Spiritist Center.  
Trhough the [Law of Affinity](/divine-laws/affinity), the medium will be required to make a profound personal choice.

The [Law of Free Will](/divine-laws/free-will) assures every person the right to choose whatever path they wish.
So a medium has every right to neglect their ability, to use it for personal economic benefit,
or to attract lower spirits that will encourage and share in the mediums worst vices.
Though they need never forget that the [Law of Cause and Effect](/divine-laws/cause-effect) assures that everyone has to 
deal with the consequences of their choices and the effects those choices have on others.

If a medium makes the choice to use their ability to do good, without self-interest, the amount of Spiritual
evolution and atonements of past mistakes that will result from this choice is immense.
The joy and personal satisfaction that comes from doing good will make all the sacrifices needed worthwhile.
Spirit friends, teachers and of course God will open doors for the medium, help them endure the daily trials 
and many become guides that will be with them every day of their lives.

Once the medium discarnates he/she will know the wonders that will come from this evolution. They will find themselves surrounded by loved ones and all those the medium has helped. A feeling of liberation and cleansing will become their new constant way of being, now liberated from the weight of many past ethical debts. Their perispirit, now less material will allow them to enjoy greater freedom and opportunities in their time in the spiritual world.

## Conclusion
Learning is a slow, life long process. The point is to strive for a tiny bit of progress every day. The above is the ideal; certainly we are all imperfect beings learning in this imperfect world.

The medium should live their life as best they can and every evening ask themselves, “Have I learned anything today?” “Have I done good today?” “What mistakes have I made today?” They need to be honest in answering those questions and let the answers be their guide for the next day.
