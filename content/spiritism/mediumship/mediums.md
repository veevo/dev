In [Spiritism](/spiritism), a medium is defined as a person who is aware of and can communicate with the [spiritual world](/about/spiritual-world).
This individual trough this other sense, is aware of a larger part of the universe than other individuals who do not have this sense developed.

The way in which this 6th sense expresses itself, and the nature of the communication that exists through this sense is widely varied.

Possession of this ability to become an intermediary between two dimensions (the [physical](/about/physical-world) and [spiritual](/about/spiritual-world))
just means that the ability has naturally developed to the point that the medium can become aware of the [phenomena](phenomena),
and can develop the ability further. 

It's important to relize that all association between mediums and an elevated ethics, moral an/or intellectual evolution are mistaken.  
Mediumship is as with any other natural ability like music or poetry, it is in way a reflection of superiority.

## Who is a medium?
[The Mediums' Book](/books/allan-kaderc/mediums-book) (published by [Allan Kardec](/bio/allan-kardec), the codifier of the Spiritist Doctrine),
is the ultimate book on how all the intercommunications between the physical and spiritual worlds happen, describes a medium as:

> "Everyone who is, to any degree, influenced by spirits is, by that very fact, a medium.
This faculty is inherent in man, and is therefore no exclusive privilege;  therefore, rare are those who do not possess some rudiments of the faculty. 
We may, therefore, assume that everyone is more or less a medium."

> [The Mediums' Book](/books/allan-kaderc/mediums-book), item #159  

In other words, **everyone is a medium** altough in different degrees. It's safe to say that all of us carry the potential to communicate with the
[spiritual world](/about/spiritual-world). This _6th sense_ is more developed in some individuals than others and is unrelated to the 
[level of progression](/about/spiritual-progression) a spirit has.  

## A Glance in the Future
In the future, the mediumistic faculty will have evolved on our planet to the point where it becomes common to everyone.
Because that day is still very distant it's common that today, when we speak of "mediums", we refer to those whom, according to
[Kardec](/bio/allan-kardec), the medianimic faculty is "practically applicable" and is "clearly characterized, producing well-marked results."
