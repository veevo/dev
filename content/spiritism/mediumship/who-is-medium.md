## Who is a Medium?
[Allan Kardec](/bio/allan-kardec), the codifier of the [Spiritist Docrtine](/spiritism) 
asked the [Superior Spirits](/about/superior-spirits) on [The Mediums' Book](/books/allan-kaderc/mediums-book):

> **159 - Who is a medium?**  
"Everyone who is, to any degree, influenced by spirits is, by that very fact, a medium.
This faculty is inherent in man, and is therefore no exclusive privilege;
therefore, rare are those who do not possess some rudiments of the faculty.
We may, therefore, assume that everyone is more or less a medium."

## We're all Mediums
According to the [Superior Spirits](/about/superior-spirits), **everyone is a medium** on their own degree.
In other words, we all have some type of mediumship and an implicit potential to communicate with the [spiritual world](/about/spiritual-world).

So, having a more [ostensive mediumship](/about/ostensive) is it good or bad?

The answer is: it depends. It depends essentially on two things:

* 1 - How are we utilizing our mediumship
* 2 - Which spirits are we connecting with.

Usually, mediumship is a very serious practice and should only be exercised inside a [Spiritist Center](/spiritism/centers).

## Development 
Please note that this [sixth sense](/about/sixth-sense) is more developed in some individuals than others and is unrelated to the 
[level of progression](/about/spiritual-progression) a spirit has. A person with more mediumship not necessarily is more
morally developed than another with less.

## Future
In the future, the mediumistic faculty will have evolved on our planet to the point where it becomes common to everyone. 
Because that day is still very distant it's common that today, when we speak of "mediums", we refer to those whom, according to Kardec,
the medianimic faculty is "practically applicable" and is "clearly characterized, producing well-marked results."
