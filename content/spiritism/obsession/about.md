## What is Obsession?
Within the context of [Spiritism](/spiritism), we use the term obsession, as [Suely Caldas Schubert](/bio/suely-schubert) writes,
to identify the situation in which 

> someone, [discarnate](/about/discarnate) or [incarnate](/about/incarnate),
exercises a negative mental constriction over someone else, for whatever reason, by means of subtle suggestion, 
inducement, or coercion, and with the objective of dominion, a process which is continuously repeated on 
Earth, as well as in the [inferior spiritual planes](/about/inferior-plan).

## Moral Deficiency
The presence of a spiritual obsession always indicates a [moral](/about/moral) deficiency, 
in both the [obsessed](/about/obsessed) and the [obsessor](/about/obsessor).

## Inferior Spirits
Likewise, spirits who obsess others are always of an [inferior nature](/about/inferior-spirits),
just as [elevated or superior spirits](/about/superior-spirits) are always noble in their sentiments and behaviors.
The latter try to advise us in our thoughts and actions, but such an influence is always positive,
and they never seek to impose their will over our own.

## Types of Obsession
The obsession can be of four types:

* **from discarnate to discarnate**
* **discarnate to incarnate**
* **incarnate to discarnate**
* **incarnate to incarnate**

## Conclusion
When we use, see, or hear the term, obsession, in a Spiritist context, however, it most often refers to the case of a discarnate 
spirit's harmful influence over an incarnate person. After all, this is probably the easiest and most likely to occur,
due to the advantage that the discarnate spirit has when he is able to remain invisible to his victim.
