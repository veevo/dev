## Introduction
Spiritism can and should be [studied](../how-to-study), analyzed and put into practice in all fundamental aspects of life,
such as: [science](../science), [philosophy](../philosophy), [religion](../religion), [ethics](/about/ethics), 
[morality](/about/moral), [virtues](/virtues), education and social life.

All practical activities that happen on [Spiritist Centers](../centers) such as 
[mediumship](../mediumship), dissemination, [fraternal assistance](../centers/fraternal-assistance) are free of any charge, 
which follows the [Gospel](/gospel) principle that we must "give for free what we receive for free.".  

Spiritist institurions don't charge for any of the work that one is expected to be there.

## Practicing Spiritism
Spiritism is practiced without rites or rituals, adhering to the Christian principle that 
[God](/about/god) should be adored in spirit and truth.

There is no ministry within Spiritism, neither does it adopt or use in its meetings
or in its practices any of the following: vestments, alcoholic beverages, incense, tobacco, 
altars, banners, candles, processions, talismans, amulets, sacraments, the making of 
promises and the paying of penances, horoscopes, fortune telling with cards or sea shells, pyramids, crystals, or any other form of cultism.

Spiritism does not impose its principles. It invites all those who are interested in exploring its teachings to submit them to the test of reason before accepting them.

## Mediumship
[Mediumship](../mediumship), which permits the communication of the [spirits](/about/spirit) with man,
is a gift anyone can have, regardless of the belief system they may choose to follow. 

Spiritist mediumship is only that which is practiced based upon the principles of Spiritism
and within Christian morality. The practice of mediumship without the [moral](/about/moral) is dangerous
and should be in all cases avoided.

Spiritism respects all religions, values all efforts towards the practice of goodness and recognizes that 

> "a true person of goodness is one who fulfils the laws of justice, love and charity in their purest forms."
