You may wonder where those who follow [Spiritism](/spiritism) go to meet, study, work, and pray.
That place where Spiritists gather is referred to as a Spiritist Center. 
There, they collaborate, with one another and with spiritual benefactors, in the study, practice, and foster Spiritism.

On this section, you'll learn more about what happens on a Spiritist Center on both
the [material plan](/about/material-plan) and on the [spiritual plan](/about/spiritual-plan).
