# Welcome! 

Welcome to the **Spiritism Section**! On this section we hope to teach you a little more about what Spiritism is, its foundations,
contributions and how it can make you a better human being.

Want to start right away?

Read our [introduction to Spiritism](about) section, read the [FAQ](faq) or jump right into the 
[Spiritist Codification](codification), the foundation of all the teachings of Spiritism.

### Why Spiritism?
But maybe you're asking yourself, why Spiritism?

Spiritism is probably the best tool to help you _[know thyself](/about/know-thyself)_.
That very (if not the most important) thing [we chose to realize in this life](/spiritism/reincarnation/planning) 
is the key to understanding why we suffer, life, death, our virtues, our morals, our vices and more, much more.

### Where to find Spiritists?
Looking to meet other Spiritists?

Spiritists usually gather on [Spiritist Centers](/spiritism/centers):
places dedicated for studying, practicing and collecting the spiritual blessings provided in the house.
On [this section](centers) you'll also learn about [Spiritist Councils](/councils), bodies that orient, 
guide and foster the Spiritist doctrine around the world.

### Educational Resources
Want to use some of our materials for education? We're glad to help.
We cover materials for adults, teenagers kids and even babies!

We also have an extensive [Books](/books) section where we provide only
Spiritist material. Feel free to also know more about [important personalities](/bio)
on the history of Spiritism.
