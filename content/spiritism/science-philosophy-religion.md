## Introduction
At a time where so much scientific knowledge is available, it's fair to ask 
why there is still so much suffering? Why aren't the scientific
advancements that Science provides us every day enough to reduce chaos, 
war and suffering around the world?

Let us remember that it's been 2000 yers since [Jesus](/about/jesus) stepped on Earth. 
His [Gospel](/gospel) which is pure love and a lesson of purity and humility,
has been incorrectly interpreted throughout the last 2000 years. 
Most of the humankind still does not understand exactly who He was and what 
[his sublime](/gospel) message was about.  

## The Triple Aspect
So where does Spiritism fit in all of this?

Good news is that Spiritism has answers for all of that. But before getting to them, 
let's review what Spiritism and its triple aspect of **Science, Philosophy and Religion**
means, and how it can help you [understanding yourself better](/about/know-thyself)
and collaborate in regenerating the humankind on this third millenium.

## Science
Let us analyze then these three aspects.

In its first aspect, [Science](/spiritism/science), 
Spiritism gives us a strong foundation on essential topics: 
the knowledge of an [invisible world](/about/spiritual-world), 
a confirmation that [life continues after death](/articles/life-after-death),
information about the multiple inhabited worlds, 
the sagas of the ancient civilizations, just to name a few.

Spiritism also teaches us about [the laws that govern the universe](/divine-laws),
how the relationship between the [material](/about/material-world) 
and [spiritual](/about/spiritual-world) worlds takes place,
the nature of the beings that inhabit them ([encarnated](/about/encarnation) or [not](/about/discarnate)),
and more.

Science and [Spiritism](/spiritism) complement one another. 
Science is unable to explain certain [phenomena](phenomena/) that Spiritism has already
documented. Spiritism also taught us about multiple findings that only now Science is
discovering or implementing. And we expect that multiple ones that it yet has no answers 
for and one day will confirm.

On the flip side, Spiritism also benefits from the Science.
Spiritists are taught to **question everything**, including the foundations of the Doctrine.
So far, none of its theories could be negated by Science.

In summary, without Science, Spiritism would not have had the credibility it has today.

## Philosophy
Its second aspect, [Philosophy](/spiritism/philosophy), Spiritism focuses on studying our [moral behaviour](/about/moral)
the [moral laws](/about/moral-laws) and the outcomes of each our our acts in our lifes and thus on the
Universe.

Spiritists also practice profound, [reflexive studies](/about/reflexive-study) of [The Gospel](/gospel),
the [Spiritist Codification](/spiritism) and from instructions and readings provided by the 
[Superior Spirits](/about/superior-spirits).

[Allan Kardec](/bio/allan-kardec) who codified the Spiritist Doctrine asked profound phylosophycal questions
to the [mentors of humankind](/about/superior-spirits), all documented on the 
[The Spirits' Book](/books/spirits-book).

That book also provides us valuable information regarding the relationship between the 
[spiritual world](/about/spiritual-world) and the [physical world](/about/material-world).
How [communication](/spiritism/mediumship/communication) between [incarnated](/about/incarnated)
and [discarnated](/about/discarnate) beings happen, proofs of the existence of [God](/about/god), 
information about the constant and infinite progress of the intelligent principle, 
through the world throughout multiple bodies.

Spiritism is a Philosophical Doctrine, but it has religious consequences, as does every spiritual philosophy,
because it touches unavoidably on the basis of all religions: God, the soul and the future life.

## Religion
And finally, the Religious aspect.

In its essence, Spiritism is not a constituted religion. It has no cult, no rites, no temples and among 
its followers none is designated as head in charge or priest.

Spiritists practice their studies in places usually called [Spiritist Centers](/spiritism/centers) which have no
simbols, rituals, sacred items or any type of hierarchy. Just dilligent people hoping to learn more about morals, virtues
the Gospel and [knowing more about themselves](/about/know-thyself).
Ah, Spiritist Centers usually have an excellent [good library!](/books).

Spiritist Centers also count with a profound and dedicated collaboration of a patient and supportive team of 
[spiritual guides](/about/spiritual-guide) that orient and guide the studies, 
while protecting and coordinating all the activities on the [spiritual plan](/about/spiritual-plan).

[Spiritism](/spiritism) has come at the predicted time to fulfill the Christâ€™s promise.
It is in its essence, Christianism revived.

#### Religare:
To ellaborate on that however, it's important to understand the word _religion_.

_Religion_ in its essence, is a word the derives from latin `Religare` which is the combination of words
`Re` and `Legare` meaning re-connect. It is supposed to denote that reconnection or
direct connection that all of us have with our eternal father, [God](/about/god),
implicit within us.

Spiritism is the the doctrine of the Spirits. It teaches us how to use implicit connection that thrives from 
the heart and reaches [God](/about/god) directly, without a need for any intermediary,
place or time.

#### The Promised Consoler:
Most people don't know that Spiritism is the [Consoler promised by Jesus on the Bible](/gospel)
which was originally menthored by [The Spirit of Truth](/about/spirit-of-truth), Jesus himself.

It is a true and profound lesson of regenaration of the soul via reflexive studies that anyone can do.
It is a call to excercise with the heart the essential virtues of 
[humility](/virtues/humility), [love](/virtues/love) and [charity](/virtues/charity).

### The Codifier
[Allan Kardec](/profiles/allan-kardec) worked a lot for the purity of the [doctrine](/spiritism).
It's important to note that the doctrine was born out of his intensive and persistent work 
after years of observation, scrutinization and confirmation.  

It's also important to state that the doctrine was neither written by Kardec (although he writes 
many sections and comments within it) neither it was dictated empirically. It is the result of a
profound collaboration between the mediums, Kardec, the [superior spirits](/about/superior-spirit) and
[The Spirit of Truth](/about/spirit-of-truth), Jesus himself.


Without a doubt it was meticulously organized by a great man. 

You can just imagine Kardec sitting at his usual table being oriented by [the Spirit of Truth](/about/spirit-of-truth)
and His [Phalange](/about/phalange), of constant workers receiving this information,
yet formulating intensive questions for clarification and accuracy.

## Conclusion
As a Science, Spiritism is allied to Religion.
As Philosophy, it has religious consequences.
As Religion it does not stand in the way of progress and will be invulnerable.

The Spiritist Doctrine, we admit, is relatively new, as it is only 152 years old, but as we visualize, 
what it embraces, it can always be considered actual.

Let us not forget that it was brought to us by a Phalange of Spirits presided over by Jesus,
and in the same manner that the Master's teachings, have remained with us for 2000 years, the Spiritist Doctrine 
will continue to shine throughout eternity, because it represents the purest truth, on the path that lead us to the Father.
