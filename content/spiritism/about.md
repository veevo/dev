## Science, Philosophy, or Religion?
All of them! Spiritism is at the same time **science, a philosophy, and religion**.

#### Science:
The [scientific aspect of Spiritism](../science) studies the existence and nature of [spirits](/about/spirit), which are nothing 
more than the [immortal souls](/about/immortal-spirit) of men, created by [God](/about/god).

Spiritism helps us understand the [natural laws](/divine-laws) that govern the evolution of the universe, 
it provides a perspective on the different types of worlds on the universe,
presents details of the life on the [spiritual world](/about/spiritual-world) and
important information regarding our own planet, ancient civilizations and more...

#### Philosophy:
The [philosophy](../philosophy), which was derived from a serious study of information received in communications 
with [discarnate spirits](/about/discarnate), deals with the details of spirit life and the journey of evolution through the process 
[reincarnation](/about/reincarnation). 

A natural consequence of that philosophy is the understanding of the role we play in our own spiritual evolution,
which is ultimately achieved through the efforts we make to grow, both morally and intellectually.


#### Religion:
The [religious aspect of Spiritism](../religion) stems from the moral ties between ourselves and others,
and the direction that Spiritism leads us, toward God, our creator, by helping us understand life and 
by teaching us, ultimately, how to develop the ability to love, in the most profound aspect of the virtue.

Spiritism also emphasizes the development of one's moral and [virtues](/virtues). From which, all the teachings
and examples come from [Jesus Christ](/about/jesus), the model and guide of humanity.
