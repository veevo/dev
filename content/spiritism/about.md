## What is spiritism?

#### A lesson of love:
Spiritism is a lesson of [love](/divine-laws/love) and [everlasting life](/about/immortal-spirit), 
in a continued pursuit of self-improvement, and [harmony](/divine-laws/harmony),
with all the creation throughout [multiple existences](/about/reincarnation).  

#### Essential and immutable truths:
[Spiritism](/spiritism) is the result of extensive and rigorous research performed by [Allan Kardec](/bio/allan-kardec).  
It is the collection of principles and laws, as revealed by the Superior Spirits,
contained in the works of Allan Kardec, which constitute the Codification of Spiritism: The Spirits' Book, The Mediums' Book, The Gospel According to Spiritism, Heaven and Hell, and Genesis.  

#### The Promised Consoler:
Spiritism is the [Promised Consoler](/about/consoler) which came, at the appointed time, 
to compliment and remind us of what [Jesus](/bio/jesus) taught, 
"reestablishing all things in their true meaning", so bringing to Humanity the true basis for spiritualization.  

The menthor of all this work was [The Spirit of Truth](/about/spirit-of-truth), Jesus himself, 
mentioned on [John 14-26](/gospel/john/14-26/).

## What does Spiritism reveal?  

#### New, proven and profound concepts:
It reveals new and more profound concepts with respect to [God](/about/god), the universe, mankind, 
the [spirits](/about/superior-spirits) and the [laws which govern life](/divine-laws).

#### Who we are, where we go, why we suffer:
Even more, it reveals what we are, from where we have originated, to where we shall go, and the cause of our pains and sufferings.  

#### Psychology, Science and Self-Awareness:
Spiritism touches on all areas of human knowledge, of all activities and the behavior of Human Beings.

## Science, Philosophy, or Religion?
All of them! Spiritism is at the same time [Science, Philosophy and Religion](/spiritism/science-philosophy-religion).

#### Science:
The [scientific aspect of Spiritism](../science) studies the existence and nature of [spirits](/about/spirit), which are nothing 
more than the [immortal souls](/about/immortal-spirit) of men, created by [God](/about/god).

Spiritism helps us understand the [natural laws](/divine-laws) that govern the evolution of the universe, 
it provides a perspective on the different types of worlds on the universe,
presents details of the life on the [spiritual world](/about/spiritual-world) and
important information regarding our own planet, ancient civilizations and more...

#### Philosophy:
The [philosophy](../philosophy), which was derived from a serious study of information received in communications 
with [discarnate spirits](/about/discarnate), deals with the details of spirit life and the journey of evolution through the process 
[reincarnation](/about/reincarnation). 

A natural consequence of that philosophy is the understanding of the role we play in our own spiritual evolution,
which is ultimately achieved through the efforts we make to grow, both morally and intellectually.


#### Religion:
The [religious aspect of Spiritism](../religion) stems from the moral ties between ourselves and others,
and the direction that Spiritism leads us, toward God, our creator, by helping us understand life and 
by teaching us, ultimately, how to develop the ability to love, in the most profound aspect of the virtue.

Spiritism also emphasizes the development of one's moral and [virtues](/virtues). From which, all the teachings
and examples come from [Jesus Christ](/about/jesus), the model and guide of humanity.
