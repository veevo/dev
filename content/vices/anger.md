Anger, also known as wrath or rage, is an intense emotional state.
It involves a strong uncomfortable and hostile response to a perceived
provocation, hurt or threat.

Settled and deliberate anger is a reaction to perceived deliberate harm or
unfair treatment by others. This form of anger is episodic. Dispositional anger
is related more to character traits than to instincts or cognitions.
Irritability, sullenness, and churlishness are examples of the last form of
anger.
