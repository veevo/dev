giving something that s/he wants or feels is due to them (often attention, love,
respect or affection) to an alternate. For example, a child will likely become
jealous when their parents give sweets to a sibling but not to them.

Jealousy generally refers to the thoughts or feelings of insecurity, fear, and
concern over a relative lack of possessions.
