Revenge (also vengeance, retribution, or vendetta amongst others) consists
primarily of retaliation against a person or group in response to a perceived
wrongdoing. Although many aspects of revenge resemble or echo the concept of
justice, revenge usually has a more injurious than harmonious goal. The goal of
revenge usually consists of forcing the perceived wrongdoer to suffer the same
pain that was originally inflicted.
