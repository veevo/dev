It is also important to point out that in all these cases, the alcoholic or the
drug addict begins to attract obsessive spirits to himself. This is because
those who have been dependent and are already disembodied, in spirituality
continue to experience everything that has lived here on Earth, that is, they remain
victims of their wills, but as they no longer have the physical body to be able to
these addictions, seek to tune in with people who use
alcohol and drugs, which are in the same vibratory pattern, and, as true
vampires, they start to use them in obsessive process to suck them out
Energies. 

Therefore, in addition to a rigorous medical treatment, the dependent is still
incarnated also needs spiritual assistance to ward off the
obsessives and prevent it from being harassed again.

## Message from a spiritual Mentor
The spiritual mentor [Joanna de Angelis](/bio/joanna-de-angelis) teaches us on
the book “Joana de Angelis Responde”, psicografia de Divaldo Franco, capítulo 14:

> "In addition to merely psychophysiological conjunctures, it is worth considering that,
> in all vicious dependence, there is always a lancinante obsessive force,
> through which perverted and addicted beings who lived on Earth and
> they mistaken, by natural process of tuning, are immanted to the creatures
> human, sometimes being the cause of evil, and in other circumstances – which is
> more common – also dependent on the false need for man to suffer."

In these cases, spiritual treatment and spiritual treatment is necessary
together with the conventional treatment, added of magnetic pass resources,
water fluidized and disobsession.
