Violence is "the use of physical force so as to injure, abuse, damage, or
destroy." Less conventional definitions are also used, such as the World
Health Organization's definition of violence as "the intentional use of physical
force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or
against a group or community, which either results in or has a high likelihood
of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or
deprivation."

Internationally, violence resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1.28 million
people in 2013 up from 1.13 million in 1990. Of the deaths in 2013, roughly
842,000 were attributed to self-harm (suicide), 405,000 to interpersonal
violence, and 31,000 to collective violence (war) and legal intervention. In
Africa, out of every 100,000 people, each year an estimated 60.9 die a violent
death. For each single death due to violence, there are dozens of
hospitalizations, hundreds of emergency department visits, and thousands of
doctors' appointments. 

Violence often has lifelong consequences for physical and mental health and
social functioning and can slow economic and social development.

The World Health Organization divides violence into three broad categories:
* self-directed violence
* interpersonal violence
* collective violence

These three broad categories are each divided further to reflect more specific
types of violence:
* physical
* sexual
* psychological
* emotional
