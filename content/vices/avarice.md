Avarice can be defined as:
* Excessive desire, especially for wealth; covetousness or avarice.
* An eager desire to possess something; inordinate desire; immoderate craving, especially for wealth or power; greed.

* An inordinate desire of gaining and possessing wealth; covetousness; cupidity; greediness, or insatiable desire of gain.

Synonyms: 
Covetousness, Cupidity, penuriousness, closeness, miserliness, all denote bad
qualities, corruptions of the natural instinct of possession. Avarice, literally
greediness, a strong desire to get objects of value, has become limited, except
in figurative uses, so as to express only a sordid and mastering desire to get
wealth. Covetousness and cupidity are not limited to wealth, but may have for
their object anything that can be desired, cupidity being directed especially
toward material things. Covetousness longs to possess that which belongs to
another; hence the prohibition in the tenth commandment (Ex. xx. 17). Cupidity
is more active than the others, less groveling, and more ready to snatch from
others that which covetousness may wish for without trying to get. See
penurious.
