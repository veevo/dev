Laziness is disinclination to activity or exertion despite having the ability to
act or to exert oneself. It is often used as a pejorative; terms for a person
seen to be lazy.

Laziness is a habit rather than a mental health issue. It may
reflect a lack of self-esteem, a lack of positive recognition by others, a lack
of discipline stemming from low self-confidence, or a lack of interest in the
activity or belief in its efficacy.

Laziness may manifest as procrastination or vacillation. Studies of motivation
suggest that laziness may be caused by a decreased level of motivation, which in
turn can be caused by over-stimulation or excessive impulses or distractions.
