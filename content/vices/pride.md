Pride is the father of all evils, it is he who unleashes all others Defects.
It's not hard to see that truth. It's out of pride that we've discussed, it's
out of pride that we fight, it is out of wounded pride that we hurt ourselves,
it is the pride that makes forgiveness difficult.

Pride is an exaggeration of self-esteem, and self-self-love is necessary for 
you must love yourself but with pride, this feeling exaggerates, which 
becomes a sick thing.

Pride prevents us from admitting our flaws and weaknesses when
we want to be better than others. We forget that we are all "creatures" of
God, therefore, we are all equal, and that realizing our shortcomings we are
knowing each other better and better able to turn them into
qualities and evolve.
