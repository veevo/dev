A smoking addiction means a person has formed an uncontrollable dependence on
cigarettes to the point where stopping smoking would cause severe emotional,
mental, or physical reactions.

Everyone knows that smoking is harmful and addictive, but few people realize
just how risky and addictive it is.

Chances are that about one in three smokers who do not stop will eventually die
because of their smoking. Some will die in their 40s, others will die later. On
average, they will die 10 to 15 years earlier than they would have died from
other causes.

The reason why so many people fail to stop is because they are addicted. Being
addicted does not mean that you cannot stop - only that it is likely to be
difficult. Anyone can succeed if he or she goes about it in the right way.
