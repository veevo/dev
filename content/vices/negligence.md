Negligence (Lat. negligentia) is a failure to exercise appropriate and or
ethical ruled care expected to be exercised amongst specified circumstances.

The core concept of negligence is that people should exercise reasonable care in
their actions, by taking account of the potential harm that they might
foreseeably cause to other people or property.
