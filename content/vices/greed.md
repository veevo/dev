Greed, or avarice, is an inordinate or insatiable longing for material gain, be
it food, money, status, or power. As a secular psychological concept, greed is
an inordinate desire to acquire or possess more than one needs.

One of the main characteristics of a greed addiction is that the individual is
focused on acquiring and maintaining their wealth and not disbursing their
fortune. This is in stark contrast with spending addicts, whose compulsion to
buying material things makes them lose all their money and drive them into
unmanageable debt.
