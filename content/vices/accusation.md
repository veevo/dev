An accusation is a statement by one person asserting that another person or
entity has done something improper. The person who makes the accusation is an
accuser, while the subject against whom it is made is the accused. 

An accusation can be made in private or in public, to the accused person alone,
or to other people with or without the knowledge of the accused person. An
accuser can make an accusation with or without evidence; the accusation can be
entirely speculative, and can even be a false accusation, made out of malice,
for the purpose of harming the reputation of the accused.
