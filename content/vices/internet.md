Internet addiction disorder also known as problematic internet use or
pathological internet use is generally defined as problematic, compulsive use of
the internet, that results in significant impairment in an individual's function
in various life domains over a prolonged period of time.

This and other relationships between digital media use and mental health have
been under considerable research, debate and discussion amongst experts in
several disciplines, and have generated controversy from the medical, scientific
and technological communities. Such disorders can be diagnosed when an
individual engages in online activities at the cost of fulfilling daily
responsibilities or pursuing other interests, and without regard for the
negative consequences.
