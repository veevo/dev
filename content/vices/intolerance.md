Intolerance is the lack of ability or willingness to tolerate something. 

Common forms of intolerance include racism, sexism, homophobia, ageism,
religious intolerance, and intolerance of differing political views. However, it
is not limited to these forms: one can be intolerant of any ideas or anyone.
Intolerance is based in prejudice, and can lead to discrimination. 

In a social or political sense, intolerance is the absence of tolerance toward
(acceptance of) people with differing viewpoints.
