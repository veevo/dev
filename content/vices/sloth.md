Sloth is usually defined as aversion to work or exertion; laziness; indolence.
In fact, it's more than that.

The Greek word we translate as sloth is ἀκηδία akedia (a = absence + kedos =
care), meaning indifference or negligence.

Many people today equate sloth with laziness. But sloth is not merely laziness;
it is more properly understood as sorrow or indifference. While sloth may
sometimes look like boredom and a casual laziness toward attaining spiritual
good, it can also be manifested by a frantic “busyness” with worldly things so
as to avoid spiritual questions or living a reflective life.

Sloth, then, is a coldness of the soul, a coldness that separates us from God
and other people. Sloth resists others’ demands on us. They are diversions of
time, energy, and resources that we could spend on our own needs, desires, and
interests.
