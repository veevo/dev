Drug addicion is the habit of continually using a substance, whether it be a
prescription drug or a street drug such as heroin, the body begins to become
physically and psychologically dependent on that drug. Most drugs will provide
the brain with a surge of dopamine, which creates a pleasurable, high sensation.
As use continues, tolerance develops, and the brain becomes unable to develop
its state of happiness without a hit from the drug. The changes drugs make to
your body is what makes it difficult to stop using, creating uncomfortable, and
dangerous withdrawal symptoms when you attempt to reduce drug use.

## Behavioral Changes
You may also notice behavioral changes due to drug use, which could indicate an
addiction:
* Prioritizing drugs over hobbies, activities, or obligations
* Missing school or work
* Criminal activity to maintain drug use (e.g., stealing)
* Problems maintaining relationships with friends and family
* Mental health issues such as anxiety, and depression



## Drugs and Obsession
It is also important to point out that the alcoholic or the
drug addict begins to attract obsessive spirits to himself. This is because
those who have been dependent and are already disembodied, in spirituality
continue to experience everything that has lived here on Earth, that is, they remain
victims of their wills, but as they no longer have the physical body to be able to
these addictions, seek to tune in with people who use
alcohol and drugs, which are in the same vibratory pattern, and, as true
vampires, they start to use them in obsessive process to suck them out
Energies. 

Therefore, in addition to a rigorous medical treatment, the dependent is still
incarnated also needs spiritual assistance to ward off the
obsessives and prevent it from being harassed again.

## Message from a spiritual Mentor
The spiritual mentor [Joanna de Angelis](/bio/joanna-de-angelis) teaches us on
the book “Joana de Angelis Answers”, psichographed by [Divaldo Franco](/bio/divaldo-franco), 
chapter 14:

> "In addition to merely psychophysiological conjunctures, it is worth considering that,
> in all vicious dependence, there is always a lancinante obsessive force,
> through which perverted and addicted beings who lived on Earth and
> they mistaken, by natural process of tuning, are immanted to the creatures
> human, sometimes being the cause of evil, and in other circumstances – which is
> more common – also dependent on the false need for man to suffer."

In these cases, spiritual treatment and spiritual treatment is necessary
together with the conventional treatment, added of magnetic pass resources,
water fluidized and disobsession.
