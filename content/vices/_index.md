Vice is a practice, behaviour, or habit generally considered immoral, sinful,
criminal, rude, taboo, depraved, or degrading in the associated society. In more
minor usage, vice can refer to a fault, a negative character trait, a defect, an
infirmity, or a bad or unhealthy habit. Vices are usually associated with a
transgression in a person's character or temperament rather than their
morality.

Vices are habits and activities that are not beneficial to an individual. It
usually produces negative consequences in the physical, emotional, mental, social,
and spiritual aspect of a person. 

## Types of Vices
Vices can be categorized in material and moral.

### Material vices
Unfortunately the vast majority of the population today is under some type of
*material vice*, including (but not limited to): drug addiction, smoking, games,
social networking, gambling, sex, pornography, drinking amongst others.

### Moral vices
Let's not forget the second (and more subtle) category of vices: moral. In this
category we can include (but not limit ourselves to): selfishness, corruption,
lazyness, pride, anger, intolerance, impatience, amongst others.

*Every human being on Earth* posess moral vices. That is because,
being a low-morally developed world, the [spirits](/about/immortal-spirit) that
here inhabit lack moral development.

## Root of vices
[Spiritism](/spiritism) sees vices as 
bad trends resulting from unfortunate experiences experienced by human beings,
current existence and past strides. However, spiritism teaches that vices can be
transformed and developed into virtues still in current life.
