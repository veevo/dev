Social media addiction is a phrase sometimes used to refer to someone
spending too much time using Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other forms of
social media â€” so much so that it interferes with other aspects of daily life.

There's no official medical recognition of social networking addiction as a
disease or disorder. Still, the cluster of behaviors associated with heavy or
excessive use of social media has become the subject of much discussion and
research.

Researchers at Chicago University concluded that social media addiction can be
stronger than addiction to cigarettes and alcohol following an experiment in which
they recorded the cravings of several hundred people for several weeks.

Sociologists and psychologists, meantime, have been exploring the impact of
social networking on real-world relationships, especially marriage, and some
have questioned whether excessive use of social media could play a role in
divorce.

The Wall Street Journal debunked reports that 1 in 5 marriages are ruined by
Facebook, noting that there appeared to be no scientific evidence supporting
such data.
