Selfishness is the habit of valuing everything only in reference to one's personal
interest; selfishness (opposed to altruism).

## The worst vice
According to the [Spiritist Doctrine](/spiritism), selfishness is the most
radical of vices. Selfishness is the true chaga of society. 

According to [Kardec](/bio/allan-kardec), question 913:
"Whoever in this life wants to approach of moral perfection must extirpar from
his heart every feeling of selfishness, because it is incompatible with justice,
love and charity: it neutralizes all other qualities."
