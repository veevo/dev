Consumerism is a social and economic order that encourages an acquisition of
goods and services in ever-increasing amounts.

One of the main problems is the addictions that derive from excessive shopping
like Oniomania (compulsive shopping, or what's more commonly referred to as
shopping addiction). 

Shopping addiction is a behavioral addiction in which a person shops
compulsively to relieve distressing negative emotions like anxiety, pain, and
sadness. People who suffer from shopping addiction tend to experience
preoccupation with shopping, uncontrollable urges to shop and spend more time
shopping than on other important activities and obligations.

People with shopping addiction tend to be more materialistic than other shoppers
and try to prop themselves up by seeking status through material objects and
seeking approval from others.
