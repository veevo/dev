Gambling addiction or gambling disorder is defined as persistent and recurring
problematic gambling behavior that causes distress and impairs your overall
livelihood. 

The desire to buy scratch tickets, play slot machines, and visit casinos aren’t
necessarily signs of gambling addiction. But when the desire to gamble becomes
overwhelming to the point you can’t stop thinking about it until you gamble on
something, may be a sign you need help. Those who suffer from gambling addiction
will continue to gamble despite negative financial, legal, and social
consequences.
