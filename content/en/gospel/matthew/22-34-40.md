But when the Pharisees had heard that He had put the Sadducees to silence, they
were gathered together. Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked Him a question,
tempting Him, and saying, Master, which is the greatest commandment in the Law? Jesus
said unto him, Thou shalt love thy God with all thy heart; and with all thy soul, and with all
thy mind. This is the first and great commandment And the second is like unto it; Thou shalt
love thy neighbour as thyself On these two commandments hang all the Law the prophets
(Matthew, 22: 34-40)
