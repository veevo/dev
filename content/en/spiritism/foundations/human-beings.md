## Human Beings
A Human Being is a Spirit incarnated in a material body. The perispirit is the semi-material body that unites the Spirit to the physical body.  
Human Beings are given the free will to act, but they must answer for the consequences of their actions.  
Physical beings constitute the visible or incarnate world; non-physical beings constitute the invisible or spiritual world, i.e. the spirit-world.  
Among the different kinds of physical beings on Earth, God has chosen the human species for the incarnation of spirits who have arrived at a certain degree of development.  This characteristic gives the human species an ethical and intellectual advantage over other living species.  
Human beings consist of the following: 1) a body, or physical being, similar to that belonging to animals and animated by the same vital principle; 2) a soul, an immaterial spirit incarnated in the body; 3) an intermediate link which unites the soul and body.  
Human beings have, accordingly, two natures: animal and spiritual.  Through the body, humans participate in the nature of animals, with which they share instincts.  Through the soul, they participate in the nature of the spirits.  
The qualities of a person are a reflection of the incarnate spirit's qualities.  Consequently, a good person is the incarnation of a good spirit, and a bad person of a less advanced one.
