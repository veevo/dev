## Body and Soul
The soul is an incarnate spirit, the body its material envelope.  
On leaving the body, the soul returns to the spirit-world, where it exists as a free spirit (i.e., free from the limitations of the physical world) and where it will stay for an indeterminate time until it enters a new incarnation.  
The soul possesses its individuality before incarnating and will preserve it after the death of the body.  
On returning to the spirit world, the soul meets those it has known on Earth.  In addition, it gradually recalls the actions, both good and harmful, of its former lives.
