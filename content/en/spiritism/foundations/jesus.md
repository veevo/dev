Jesus is the Guide and Model for all Humankind. The Doctrine He taught and exemplified is the most pure expression of Godâ€™s Law.  
The morality of Christ, as contained in the Gospels, is the pathway for the secure progress of all Human Beings. Its practice is the solution for all human problems and the objective to be attained by Humankind.
