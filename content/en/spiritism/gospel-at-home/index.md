The **Gospel At Home** is a special time set aside each week for family or household members to gather at home and jointly elevate their thoughts in prayer and study. As the name suggests, the focus of study is on the collection of moral lessons, comforting passages, and encouraging words, inspired by the teachings and examples left by our brother and mentor, [Jesus](/about/jesus), as found in the book, [The Gospel According to Spiritism](/books/allan-kardec/gospel-according-spiritism).

During this time, family members read a passage from  [The Gospel According to Spiritism](/books/allan-kardec/gospel-according-spiritism) and share comments and reflections, often relating the lesson to the events of their current lives.	      	

This is a powerful moment, not only for fortifying the moral character and emotional strength of the participants, but also for strengthening ties, both among the individuals and with the good spirits that look after them.
