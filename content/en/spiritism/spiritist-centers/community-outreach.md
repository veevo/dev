Spiritist centers often organize different activities, sometimes as one-time events and other times on a regular schedule, that offer social assistance to their community. A few examples may be: the collection and donation of food, clothing, etc; the provision of free medical assistance to the poor, offered by doctors volunteering their time;  friendly visits at hospitals, nursing homes and orphanages; educational campaigns; and other activities in which members can volunteer their time and abilities to help those less fortunate than themselves.
