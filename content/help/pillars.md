Veevo.org is an independent no-profit organization, privacy-focused and completely
developed and run by a team of dedicated unpaid volunteers. We don't host ads
neither get any financial benefit from this site. 

On this page, you will understand more about our pillars:  
Spiritism, Education, Collaboration and No Profit.

## Spiritism
Our first, and essential pillar is [Spiritism](/spiritism). It's important to highlight
that [Spiritism](/spiritism) is not someone's work. It's the doctrine of the
[Superior Spirits](/about/superior-spirits) promised by [Jesus](/about/jesus) on
[John 14:26](/gospel/jo/14/26): 

> But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my
name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance,
whatsoever I have said unto you.

Through Spiritism, [tousands of books](/books) and an uncountable number of
[spiritual communications](/spiritism/mediumship/communication) are being
received every day teaching us about self-knowledge, science, philosophy, moral
and religion.

We only publish content that adheres to the [Spiritist Teachings](/spiritism/teachings)
and comes from reliable sources. Every content is revised by a team of dedicated
volunteers.

Please notice that we require that any content hosted on this website respect
our legal terms. For more information, please read our [disclaimer](../disclaimer).

## Education
Our second pillar is Education. We believe that only through education
we can know ourselves better, develop our virtues and understand  
[complex issues facing the world today](/vices).

It's important to highlight that education is also cited by [The Spirit of
Truth](/about/spirit-of-truth) on [The Gospel According to
Spiritism](/books/gospel-according-spiritism/5-5), Chapter VI - Item 5 as a
one of the most important teachings we got so far:

> Espíritas! amai-vos, este o primeiro ensinamento; instruí-vos, este o segundo. 
No Cristianismo encontram-se todas as verdades; são de origem humana os erros que nele se enraizaram. 
Eis que do além-túmulo, que julgáveis o nada, vozes vos clamam: “Irmãos! nada perece. 
Jesus Cristo é o vencedor do mal, sede os vencedores da impiedade.”

## Collaboration
We believe that everyone benefits from an collaborative environment. For that
reason, we openly share everything that we do with the public.

We also believe that collaboration is an essential tool for growing, helping
and learning. We follow the teachings of [Superior Spirits](/over/superior spirits)
who collaborated to transmit Spiritism to us and still collaborate with us today all
time. Therefore, every person, provided that properly instructed, is welcome to
participate in our community.

## No Profit
We're a non-profit organization. But we go further: we choose to operate at zero
profit organization. We don't host ads, we don't pay employees, and we don't ask
for donations.

Our operating costs are covered by generous donations from anonymous volunteers
of the Veevo community. To minimize costs, we also run our services using
free/open source tools and, where possible, making use of open and free
platforms.

Spiritism teaches us that we should not charge for what does not belong to us.
We hope to pass on the message of helping without expecting anything in return.
In the meantime, we would kindly ask our readers for a favor: that they
dedicate part of their time volunteering in a local charity helping those in
need.

Speaking of charity, the only charity we ask is that you love yourself, respect
your neighbor and the Mother Nature. Visit the [Charity](/virtues/charity) section 
for more understanding how our vision of charity differs from what the world
sees it.
