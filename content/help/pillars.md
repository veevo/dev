Veevo.org is an independent, zero-profit, privacy-focused, completely volunteered developed and run organization.
We don't host ads neither get any financial benefit from this site. 

On this page, you will understand more about our five pillars:  
**Spiritism, Education, Openness, Collaboration and Zero Profit.**

## Spiritism
Our first, and most important pillar is [Spiritism](/spiritism). [Spiritism](/spiritism) is not someone's work.
It's the doctrine of the [Superior Spirits](/about/superior-spirits) promised by [Jesus](/about/jesus) on [John 14-26](/gospel/john/14-26): 

> But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall 
teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.

Spiritism's mission is to revive [His Doctrine](/gospel) on its purest essence: 
that lived and exemplified by the first Christans on the first three centuries of our 
era but then so much distorted, misinterpreted, ignored and misunderstood by the humanity for over 2000 years.

Through Spiritism, [tousands of books](/books) and uncountable [reliable communications](/spiritism/mediumship/communication) are 
happening every day talking humanity, science, philosophy, moral and religion.

We also only publish and host content that adheres to [Spiritim Teachings](/spiritism/teachings) and comes from reliable sources. We revice every published content. Please notice that we require that any content hosted on this website respects the in this site If not, please [report an error](/contribute/report-error) and we will happily fix it.

## Education
Our second pillar is Education. Education is the best tool to erradicate the [issues the world faces today](/vices). We also view Education as a 
fundamental tool for [self-awereness](/about/self-awereness) and [moral development](/divine-laws).

Education is also cited by [The Spirit of Truth](/about/spirit-of-truth) on 
[The Gospel According to Spiritism](/books/gospel-according-spiritism/5-5), 
Chapter VI - Item 5 as the solution to humankind issues:

> Espíritas! amai-vos, este o primeiro ensinamento; instruí-vos, este o segundo. 
> No Cristianismo encontram-se todas as verdades; são de origem humana os erros que nele se enraizaram. 
> Eis que do além-túmulo, que julgáveis o nada, vozes vos clamam: “Irmãos! nada perece. 
> Jesus Cristo é o vencedor do mal, sede os vencedores da impiedade.”

## Openness
We believe that everyone benefits from an open collaboration environment. 
We are proud to share that everything that we do should be open to the public for inspection
and improvement and nothing should be hidden. 

We [keep our source code code open](https://github.com/veevo),
we provide an open channel for [contribution](/contribute), [communication](/help/contact-us) 
and [error reporting](/contribute/report-error). 
We also expose whenever possible the original source of every published material and, 
if necessary translation information so our users can validate that using other mediums.

We have an open channel for [questions](/help/contact-us) and accept 
requests of [articles](/articles). All for the benefit of the community.

## Collaboration
We believe that Collaboration is a strong tool to grow, share and learn.
In fact, we follow the [Superior Spirits](/about/superior-spirits) teachings who collaborated to build 
Spiritism and still collaborate today with us all the time. 
We strongly believe that any person should be allowed collaborate so everyone else benefits. 

Examples of how you could collaborate ar by: [sharing](/contribute/share), [translating content](/contribute/translate),
suggesting and recommending articles, asking questions, [reporting and/or fixing errors](/contribute/submit-a-fix)

You are more then welcome to help us out! 
Check our [Contribute](/contribute) page for more information on how to contribute with us.

## Zero Profit
We are a Zero-Profit organization: we run completely revenue-free, 
we don't make a single cent from this website,
we [don't host ads](../privacy), we have no payed employees and we don't expect donations.

All the work and operational costs are kindly donated by anonymous contributors from the Veevo Community.
In order to minimize costs we also run our services on free/open source resources as much as possible.

We strongly belive that we should not charge for this knowledge (since it does not belong to us) and we
help people without any secondary intention.

If ever, we kindly ask our readers to volunteer in [Spiritist Centers](/spiritism/centers),
divulging Spiritism or working on a local charity. The only charity we ask for is that that you would do for yourself:
love yourself and love your neighbour. Check the [Charity](/virtues/charity) page for more 
information on how we understand charity and how it is different from the materialist aspect of simply donating money.
