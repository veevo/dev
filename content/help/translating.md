## Introduction
[Veevo.org](//en.veevo.org)'s objective is to have its database translated to as many languages as possible.
However, due to the massive size of our library and given the small size of our community,
we are not capable of translating all the material we host as fast as we would like.

## Current Languages
We are currently only serving content in [Portuguese](//br.veevo.org) and [English](//en.veevo.org).
However, we are already in the process of translating all our content to [French](//fr.veevo.org) and [Spanish](//es.veevo.org)
with more languages arriving later.

When? Just time will tell. We hope to build a framework that allows volunteers to engage and contribute
more quickly but that's still in the works.

## Translations
Because Veevo.org is a multi-language website, every piece of content requires a translation
as we strive to keep all languages up to date. As expected, every language supported will require another translation.
For example, after French and Spanish go live, at least three translations will be required for every piece of content.

Add to that the fact that we still validate and review every single piece of published content, it's a massive undertaking.

## How can you help
There are three main ways one can help: Reporting Errors, Fixing and Translating Content.

### Reporting Translation Errors
For information on how to report errors, please [check this page](/contribute/report-error).

### Fixing Translations
Found an issue with a piece of content? Please [contact us](/help/contact-us). We are working
on a framework to speed up this workflow. More on that later.

### Translating Content
As previously said, we want to be running on [Portuguese](//br.veevo.org), [English](//en.veevo.org),
[French](//fr.veevo.org) and [Spanish](//es.veevo.org]) as soon as we can.
Would you like to help in any of these languages? Please [drop us a note](/help/contact-us).


## Other Languages
But what about other languages? Of course we don't want to stop there! After all, we want every person on this world to
_know thyself_. In the future we would like to extend our translations to _at least_:

* Mandarin
* Japanese
* Arabic
* Korean
* Italian
* German

Are you native in one of these languages? If you would like to volunteer,
please [send us a note](/help/contact-us). We will love to hear from you.
