Our volunteers review and validate all published content, however we cannot
ensure that there will be no errors in our site.

Found a mistake and don't know how to proceed? Keep reading.

## Types of errors
The following types of errors are the most common: translation, typos,
source, author and content.

### Spelling Errors
Spelling errors and typos are the most common and very simple to correct. 
You are very welcome to report to us through the contact form.

### Translation Errors
Translation errors are also common. Our volunteers strive to translate the huge
amount of content we host. However due to the size of our catalog, 
and given that some of our translators are not native, it is possible
that there will be errors.

To report and help with translation errors, [please contact us](.. /contact).

### Missing or invalid source
Whenever possible, we expose the original source and if necessary, the responsible
for the translation (Veevo community, book, publisher, etc). This information is
very important because they help our visitors to save or study that material
later as has to be accurate.

If you find content without the minimum information (Book name,
author and/or source), please contact us.

## Content errors
We only import content from trusted authors and sources. In case you
detect an error, do not hesitate to contact.

### Other types of errors
For any other type of error, please contact us.
