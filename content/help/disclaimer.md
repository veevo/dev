## Content
We strongly believe in the power of [Education](/pillars/education). That said,
we have rigorous rules regarding the authors we publish. Given the complexity we
only publish content from a small list of selected authors. The only content
that we write ourselves are pages like this, descriptions or introductions. 

When the content is not authored by us, we strive to provide the original
source, author name, publication name, access date and applicable additional
information. Errors and copyright infringements can be reported using the
[contact form](/help/contact-us) page.

## Translations
Our primary mission is to foster the [Spiritist Doctrine](/spiritism) to as many
people as possible _in the world_ so that they also can _know thyselves_. That
means translating content to and from different languages. Due to the massive
size of our database and to the diminute size of our team, we often recur to
automated translation. While our volunteers revise all content before publishing, 
errors may still occurr - be in revision, be in translation - because we still don't have
native translators in all languages we operate in.

But rest assured: our [Openness](/help/pillars/#openness) pillar guarantees that
we'll always keep an open channel so readers can report and/or fix errors when
applicable.

## Privacy
We are an independent, extremely concerned about your privacy developing this
independet work only by volunteers. We don't host ads, we don't store cookies
and we don't benefit financially in any shape of form from this site. We believe
that being a [no-profit organization](/pillars/no-profit) provides a solid
foundation to reach our objectives respecting your privacy.

Please also notice that due to its simplicity, our website restricts to the
minium, the dependencies on third-party software that we use so that your privacy is
respected at the most. Also, our open-codebase guarantees that what we affirm
here be audited when necessary.

We also don't store any information in a database. All communication is private,
anonymous and will never be divulged.

## Third-Party Providers
In order to minimize our costs, we rely on generous services from companies like
[GitHub](//github.com), [Microsoft Azure](//azure.com), [Twitter](//twitter.com)
and [Google](//google.com). Please note that these companies may have different
policies than ours. If you care about your privacy, feel free to use the [ad
blocking software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_blocking) of your
preference.

## Downloadable Content
We strive to link and serve only freely distributable material. As most of the
content available was released a long time ago, was dictated by [Superior
Spirits](/about/superior-spirits) or [psicographed](/about/psichography) by
[mediums](/about/medium) who don't impose rigid copyright on spiritual works,
and due to the fact that we financially don't benefit in any from from that work, 
we publish freely part of that content.

For copyright infringiments, please check the _Removal of Content_ section to
know how to proceed.

The stated above also applies to videos posted on this site. All links point to
videos hosted on public video platforms (YouTube et al). In case any of that
content is copyrighted, please contact the owner of that channel directly. In
dout, don't hesitate to [reach out to us](/help/contact-us).

## Errors
Every published content on this website comes from reliable authors and reliable
publishers. While we review and validate every content here published
against the solid principles of the [Spiritist Doctrine](/spiritism), 
sometimes we make mistakes. Possible reasons are: 
* error on the source - either how the data was imported or how it was digitalized;
* translation - how it was translated by us (or another translator);
* revision - either by typing or during revision.

If you spot an error, feel free [to report it to us](/contribute/report-error).

## Removal of Content
In case any of the published content here published violates any copyright, feel
free to [contact us](/help/contact-us) and we will be happy to remove.

## Response Time
[Openness](/pillars/openness), one of our pillars also implies that we should
reply inquiries as fast as possible. While we do our best efforts to respond as
fast as possible, please note that we are an organization completely run by
volunteers and delays may occur. 

For any contact, feel free to [contact us](/help/contact-us) and we will be
happy to get back to you.
