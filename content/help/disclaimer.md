## Content
We strongly believe in [Education](/pillars/education). We have rigid rules on the authors that we publish. Given the complexity of the topic and how easy it is to make mistakes, we only publish content from a small list of selected authors. The only content that we write ourselves are pages like this, descriptions or introductions. 

For content not authored by us, we strive to provide the original source, author name, publication name, access date and additional information when and where applicable. Errors and copyright infringements can be reported using the [contact form](/help/contact-us) page on this site. 

For more information, please also check the [Errors](#errors) and [Removal of Content](#removal-of-content) sections below for more details.

## Translations
Our primary mission is to foster the [Spiritist Doctrine](/spiritism) to as many people as possible _in the world_ so that they also can _know thyselves_. That means translating content to and from different languages. Due to the massive size of our database and to the small size of the team, we often recur to automated translation. While we revise every content before publishing, errors may still occurr as we don't have native translators for all languages that we serve content from.

But rest assured: our [Openness](/help/pillars/#openness) pillar guarantees that readers should be able to report and/or fix errors when applicable.
