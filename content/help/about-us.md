## About Veevo Portal
[Veevo.org](//veevo.org) is an independent organization that respects your
privacy and is completely developed, kept and run by a community of unpaid
volunteers. 

We don't host ads, we don't track you and we don't build 
[any profit](/help/pillars/#no-profit) track you, we don't generate any financial benefit from this website and we will
never will.

We believe that by being a [no-profit organization](/help/pillars/#no-profit)
we can focus on our essential purpose: enlighten humanity by helping
people to [know thyselves](/about/know-thyself).

## Our Mission
Our mission is to engage our readers on [profound reflexive
studies](/about/reflexive-study) promoting
[self-awareness](/about/self-awareness) - a virtue so important for our moral
development but sill so ignored - through a profound comprehension of the
[Gospel of Jesus](/gospel) according to the vision of [Spiritism](/spiritism).

## What is Spiritism?
But what is Spiritism? [Spiritism](/spiritism) is not someone's work.  It's the
doctrine of the [Superior Spirits](/about/superior-spirits) promised by
[Jesus](/about/jesus) on [John 14:26](/gospel/jo/14/26):

> But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my
name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, 
whatsoever I have said unto you.

Spiritism's mission is to revive [the Doctrine of the Christ Comforter](/gospel)
on its purest essence: that lived and exemplified by the first Christans on the
first three centuries of our era and then so much distorted, misinterpreted,
manipulated and misunderstood by the humanity for over 2000 years.

[Spiritism](/spiritism) was codified by [Allan Kardec](/bio/allan-kardec) which
investigated and documented in depth different types of spiritual influences
(good and bad) and all the work was mentored directly by the [Spirit of
Truth](/about/spirit-of-truth), Jesus Himself.

## Where does the name `Veevo` come from?
`Veevo` when pronounced in English has the same phonetic as `vivo` in the
beautiful [Portuguese Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language).
`Veevo` in Portuguese means `alive` or `I live`. Both of which perfectly representing 
our immortal essence.

We spiritists already know that in essence, we're [immortal spirits](/about/immortal-spirit) 
- to which which there's no [death](/about/death), just life. A glorious, 
[happy](/about/happiness), [virtuous](/virtues) and [eternal life](/about/eternal-life)
- and we wanted to share that feeling with all the humanity.

## What are our Pillars?
Our Pillars are: Spiritism, Education, Openness, Collaboration and No Profit.
For more information, please check our [pillars page](/help/pillars).

## Content
As mentioned, we believe (and were instructed to) promote [Education](/pillars/education)
and [self-awareness](/about/self-awareness). Due to that, it's important that we
be rigorous with the quality of the material we provide so we do not disclose content 
that does not adhere to the precepts of Spiritism.

For that reason, we only publish content from primarily trusted authors and
sources that respect and honor the Spiritist Doctrine and the Gospel of Jesus.
All that rigidness is important because small distortions can cause big
misunderstandings.
