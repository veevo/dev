## About Veevo.org
Veevo.org is an independent, privacy-focused, completely volunteered, developed and run organization. We run completely revenue-free, we don't host ads, we don't get any financial benefit from this website and we will never will. We believe that being a [zero-profit organization](/help/pillars/#no-profit) provides a solid foundation to reach our goals: enlighten humanity and help people to _know thyself_.  

## Our Mission
Our mission is to engage our readers on constructive and profound [reflexive studies](/about/reflexive-study) that engage and promote self-awereness through the profound and life-changing teachings of [Spiritism](/spiritism) and [The Gospel of Jesus](/gospel).

## What is Spiritism?
[Spiritism](/spiritism) is not someone's work. It's the doctrine of the [Superior Spirits](/about/superior-spirits) promised by [Jesus](/about/jesus) on [John 14-26](/gospel/john/14-26):

> But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.

Spiritism's mission is to revive His Doctrine on its purest essence: that lived and exemplified by the first Christans on the first three centuries of our era but then so much distorted, misinterpreted, ignored and misunderstood by the humanity for over 2000 years.

It's the [Comforter](/about/comforter)  codified by [Allan Kardec](/bio/allan-kardec) and mentored by the [Spirit of Truth](/about/spirit-of-truth), Jesus Himself.

## Where does the name `Veevo` come from?
Veevo, as pronounced in English has the same phonetic as *"vivo"* in the beautiful [Portuguese Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language). *Vivo* in Portuguese means **"alive"** or **"I live"**.  Both perfectly represent our essential and immortal nature. Spiritists know they're primarily and essentially an [Immortal Spirit](/about/immortal-spirit) for which there's no [death](/about/death), just life, a glorious, happy, virtuous and Eternal Life.

## What are our Pillars?
Our Pillars are: Spiritism, Education, Openness, Collaboration and No Profit. For more information, please check our [Pillars](/help/pillars) page.

## Content
We strongly believe on [Education](/pillars/education). We only publish content from primarily trusted authors on this site that respect and honor the Spiritist Doctrine and the Gospel faithfully. It's also important to note that not every communication is serious and unexperienced readers can be easily deceived by false or deceiving thoughts.

## Translations
We also translate and revise every published content. Our intention is to be as faithful as possible to the original source, always adhering to our Pillars and respecting our rigid guidelines. Please note that given the amount of content we host (more than 10,000 pages), errors may happen but you're invite to collaborate. Please check the [Error](#errors) and [Contribute](/contribute) sections for more information.

We also provide a lot of content for reading and studying such as [books](/books), [movies](/movies), [videos](/videos), [articles](/articles) and more. Please check our [Resources](/resources) page where we show all the categories available on the site. We also provide a [search tool](/search) tool so you can quickly find what you're looking for.

## Copyleft
We invite eveyone to [share our content](/contribute/share) freely. We expose this website under [Copyleft terms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft), which means that we offer people the right to freely distribute copies of our work with the stipulation that the same rights be preserved in derivative works created late.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft):

> Copyleft is a form of licensing, and can be used to maintain copyright conditions for works ranging from computer software, to documents, to art, to scientific discoveries and instruments in medicine.[3] In general, copyright law is used by an author to prohibit recipients from reproducing, adapting, or distributing copies of their work. In contrast, under copyleft, an author must give every person who receives a copy of the work permission to reproduce, adapt, or distribute it, with the accompanying requirement that any resulting copies or adaptations are also bound by the same licensing terms. 

> Copyleft type licenses are a novel use of existing copyright law to ensure a work remains freely available.

However, we have one request: that when shared, the content from this site be not modified. Any modification may cause serious damage on the original work deteriorating the quality of the work and consequently its essential message.

## Errors
While every published content is reviewed and validated against the foundations of the [Spiritist Doctrine](/spiritism), sometimes we make mistakes. If you spot one, feel free to [report it to us](/contribute/report-error) page or by using one of the other channels available to do so.

## Response Time
[Openness](/help/pillars/#openness), one of our pillars, is also a commitment that we should reply inquiries as fast as possible. While we do our best efforts to respond as quick as possible, please note that delays may occur.
