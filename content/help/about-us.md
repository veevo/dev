Veevo.org is an independent, privacy-focused, completely volunteered developed and run organization. We don't host ads, we don't get any financial benefit and we will never will.
We believe that being a [zero-profit organization](/help/pillars/#no-profit) provides a solid foundation to reach our goals.

## Our Mission
Our mission is to enlighten us, human beings by teaching us how to _know thyself_ through the teachings of [Spiritism](/spiritism).

### What is Spiritism?
Spiritism is not someone's work. It's the doctrine of the Spirits promised by Earth's Spiritual guide, [Jesus](/about/jesus). It's the **Comforter** promised in the [Gospel](/gospel) on [John 14-26](/gospel/john/14-26). Spiritism's mission is to revive His Doctrine so much misinterpreted, distorted, misunderstood and ignored by the humanity for over 2000 years.


## Where does the name `Veevo` come from?
Veevo, as pronounced in English has the same phonetic as *"vivo"* in the beautiful [Portuguese Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language). *Vivo* in Portuguese means **"alive"** or **"I live"**.  Both perfectly represent our essential immortal nature. Spiritists know they're primarily an [Immortal Spirit](/about/immortal-spirit) for which there's no [death](/about/death), just life, a glorious, happy and Eternal Life.

## What are our Pillars?
Our pillars are: **Spiritism, Education, Openness, Collaboration and No Profit**. For more information, please check the [Pillars](/help/pillars) page.

## Content
We strongly believe in [Education](/pillars/education). While we build and publish content from other authors on this site, we also translate and revise every published content.

Please check the [Error](#errors) and [Contribute](/contribute) sections for more information.

We also strive to provide a lot of content to study such as [books](/books), [movies](/movies), [videos](/videos), [articles](/articles) and more. We also provide a [Resources](/resources) page where we show all the available categories on the site and also provide a  [search tool](/search) tool so you can quickly find what you're looking for. Be sure to also check the [Get Started](/get-started) section for a step-by-step on how to build a plan of study suitable to you.
