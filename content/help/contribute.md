Veevo.org is an organization open to contributions. We host our
services in open repositories precisely so that everyone can collaborate.

## What can I do?
We accept different levels of contributions such as [translations](.. /translate), 
[typos] (.. /report-error) and even [sharing articles](../share).

Every bit helps!

## How to send a fix
For now, we are only accepting contributions through the [
contact](/help/contact-us).

In the future, we will engage our volunteers in a more simplified workflow.
Keep an eye on this page as it will be updated as soon as the new template has been
Live.

Thank you for your help!
