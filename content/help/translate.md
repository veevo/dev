Our goal is to have our platform translated into as many languages as
possible. However, due to the size of our library and given the 
size of our community, we are not able to translate all the content of
our website as fast as we would like.

## Current languages
Currently, our content is only available in [Portuguese](/br.veevo.org) and
[English](//en.veevo.org). However, we have already started the translations for 
[French](//fr.veevo.org) and [Spanish](//es.veevo.org).

Would you like to help? Keep reading to learn how.

## Translations
Because our site is multilingual, it is important that every article be
translated into the languages we operate. This requires a lot of discipline,
commitment and organization from our translators due to the huge amount of
articles we make available.

## How can you help
There are three main ways to help: reporting errors, correcting, and translating
content.

### Reporting translation errors
For information on how to report errors, please [check this page](../report error). 

We are working on a tool to provide a specific page for reporting errors direct
from this site.

### Fixing translations
Did you find a problem in an article? Please contact [please contact us](../contact).

### Translating texts
Would you like to help any in any of our languages? Please [please contact us](../contact).

## Other languages
But what about the other languages? Of course we don't want to stop there! Our
goal is to translate Veevo into as many languages as possible because we want
everyone to know themselves.

The languages we would like to translate in the near future are:
* Mandarin
* Japanese
* Arabic
* Korean
* German
* Russian

Are you native in any of these languages? If you would like to help, please
[contact] (.. /contact). We'd love to hear from you.
