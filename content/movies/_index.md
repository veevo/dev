On this section, we present movies that are faithful to the [Spiritist
Doctrine](/spiritism). These movies are lessons, usually based on lives of people
who exercised the [virtues](/virtues) to its essence.

Why watch Spiritist movies? Because we believe that, Spiritism is the key to
regenerate the humanity. And this regeneration has to start within ourselves
first.

We hope these videos also help you understand where you came from, why you're
here, understand the reasons of your own sufferings and how your actions can
influence your present and future.

Peace!
