Living with mediumship since the age of four, Divaldo was
rejected by the other children and repressed by the father. At the age of 17, the
young man decides to use his gift to help people and moves to Salvador, with the
support from the mother.

Under the guidance of his spiritual guide, Joanna of Angelas, he becomes one of the
most important mediums of all time.
