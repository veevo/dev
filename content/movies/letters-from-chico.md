The Letters Psychographed by Chico Xavier, documentary by Cristiana Grumbach with
the participation of families who received news from their loved ones by
half of letters psychographed by spiritist medium Francisco CÃ¢ndido Xavier.

The Letters Psychographed by Chico Xavier is a film of conversations and silence.
Feelings, memories, images of someone's lack. The search for encouragement for the
unnamed pain. Words arrive on handwritten paper.  The letters are read.
Survive this pain, live still. The letters are the links between mothers and
children, between Chico and these mothers and their children, between the audience and the film.
